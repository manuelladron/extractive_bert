      "b\"\\xc79marseille , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- the french prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of germanwings flight 9525 insisted wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane . marseille prosecutor brice robin told cnn that `` so far no videos were used in the crash investigation . '' he added , `` a person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators . '' robin 's comments follow claims by two magazines , german daily bild and french paris match , of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board germanwings flight 9525 as it crashed into the french alps . all 150 on board were killed . paris match and bild reported that the video was recovered from a phone at the wreckage site . the two publications described the supposed video , but did not post it on their websites . the publications said that they watched the video , which was found by a source close to the investigation . `` one can hear cries of ` my god ' in several languages , '' paris match reported . `` metallic banging can also be heard more than three times , perhaps of the pilot trying to open the cockpit door with a heavy object . towards the end , after a heavy shake , stronger than the others , the screaming intensifies . then nothing . '' `` it is a very disturbing scene , '' said julian reichelt , editor-in-chief of bild online . an official with france 's accident investigation agency , the bea , said the agency is not aware of any such video . lt. col. jean-marc menichini , a french gendarmerie spokesman in charge of communications on rescue efforts around the germanwings crash site , told cnn that the reports were `` completely wrong '' and `` unwarranted . '' cell phones have been collected at the site , he said , but that they `` had n't been exploited yet . '' menichini said he believed the cell phones would need to be sent to the criminal research institute in rosny sous-bois , near paris , in order to be analyzed by specialized technicians working hand-in-hand with investigators . but none of the cell phones found so far have been sent to the institute , menichini said . asked whether staff involved in the search could have leaked a memory card to the media , menichini answered with a categorical `` no . '' reichelt told `` erin burnett : outfront '' that he had watched the video and stood by the report , saying bild and paris match are `` very confident '' that the clip is real . he noted that investigators only revealed they 'd recovered cell phones from the crash site after bild and paris match published their reports . `` that is something we did not know before . ... overall we can say many things of the investigation were n't revealed by the investigation at the beginning , '' he said . what was mental state of germanwings co-pilot ? german airline lufthansa confirmed tuesday that co-pilot andreas lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of germanwings flight 9525 , which he 's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the french alps . lubitz told his lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a `` previous episode of severe depression , '' the airline said tuesday . email correspondence between lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation , lufthansa said , included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training . the announcement indicates that lufthansa , the parent company of germanwings , knew of lubitz 's battle with depression , allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit . lufthansa , whose ceo carsten spohr previously said lubitz was 100 % fit to fly , described its statement tuesday as a `` swift and seamless clarification '' and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors . spohr traveled to the crash site wednesday , where recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside . he saw the crisis center set up in seyne-les-alpes , laid a wreath in the village of le vernet , closer to the crash site , where grieving families have left flowers at a simple stone memorial . menichini told cnn late tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching . french president francois hollande , speaking tuesday , said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using dna analysis by the end of the week , sooner than authorities had previously suggested . in the meantime , the recovery of the victims ' personal belongings will start wednesday , menichini said . among those personal belongings could be more cell phones belonging to the 144 passengers and six crew on board . check out the latest from our correspondents . the details about lubitz 's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and lubitz 's possible motive for downing the jet . a lufthansa spokesperson told cnn on tuesday that lubitz had a valid medical certificate , had passed all his examinations and `` held all the licenses required . '' earlier , a spokesman for the prosecutor 's office in dusseldorf , christoph kumpa , said medical records reveal lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot 's license . kumpa emphasized there 's no evidence suggesting lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash . investigators are looking into whether lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot 's license , a european government official briefed on the investigation told cnn on tuesday . while flying was `` a big part of his life , '' the source said , it 's only one theory being considered . another source , a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation , also told cnn that authorities believe the primary motive for lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems . lubitz 's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist , both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues , the european government official said . but no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles , there 's more to the story , said brian russell , a forensic psychologist . `` psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they were n't going to keep doing their job and they 're upset about that and so they 're suicidal , '' he said . `` but there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person 's problems .

'' later that month , the icc opened a preliminary examination into the situation in palestinian territories , paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against israelis . as members of the court , palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well . israel and the united states , neither of which is an icc member , opposed the palestinians ' efforts to join the body . but palestinian foreign minister riad al-malki , speaking at wednesday 's ceremony , said it was a move toward greater justice . `` as palestine formally becomes a state party to the rome statute today , the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice , '' he said , according to an icc news release . `` indeed , today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace . '' judge kuniko ozaki , a vice president of the icc , said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the palestinians . `` as the rome statute today enters into force for the state of palestine , palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a state party to the statute . these are substantive commitments , which can not be taken lightly , '' she said . rights group human rights watch welcomed the development . `` governments seeking to penalize palestine for joining the icc should immediately end their pressure , and countries that support universal acceptance of the court 's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership , '' said balkees jarrah , international justice counsel for the group . `` what 's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice , not palestine 's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members . '' in january , when the preliminary icc examination was opened , israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu described it as an outrage , saying the court was overstepping its boundaries . the united states also said it `` strongly '' disagreed with the court 's decision . `` as we have said repeatedly , we do not believe that palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the icc , '' the state department said in a statement . it urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations . `` we will continue to oppose actions against israel at the icc as counterproductive to the cause of peace , '' it said . but the icc begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as `` palestine . '' while a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation , it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides . prosecutor fatou bensouda said her office would `` conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality . '' the war between israel and hamas militants in gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead . the inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since june . the international criminal court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . cnn 's vasco cotovio , kareem khadder and faith karimi contributed to this report .H\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa0'-lrb- cnn -rrb- governments around the world are using the threat of terrorism -- real or perceived -- to advance executions , amnesty international alleges in its annual report on the death penalty . `` the dark trend of governments using the death penalty in a futile attempt to tackle real or imaginary threats to state security and public safety was stark last year , '' said salil shetty , amnesty 's secretary general in a release . `` it is shameful that so many states around the world are essentially playing with people 's lives -- putting people to death for ` terrorism ' or to quell internal instability on the ill-conceived premise of deterrence . '' the report , `` death sentences and executions 2014 , '' cites the example of pakistan lifting a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians following the horrific attack on a school in peshawar in december . china is also mentioned , as having used the death penalty as a tool in its `` strike hard '' campaign against terrorism in the restive far-western province of xinjiang . the annual report catalogs the use of state-sanctioned killing as a punitive measure across the globe , and this year 's edition contains some mixed findings . on one hand , the number of executions worldwide has gone down by almost 22 % on the previous year . at least 607 people were executed around the world in 2014 , compared to 778 in 2013 . amnesty 's figures do not include statistics on executions carried out in china , where information on the practice is regarded as a state secret . belarus and vietnam , too , do not release data on death penalty cases . `` the long-term trend is definitely positive -- we are seeing a decrease in the number of executions -lrb- worldwide -rrb- , '' audrey gaughran , amnesty 's director of global issues , told cnn . `` a number of countries are closer to abolition , and there are some signs that some countries will be abolitionist by 2015 . -lrb- there are -rrb- signals of a world that is nearing abolition . '' while the report notes some encouraging signs , it also highlights a marked increase in the number of people sentenced to death in 2014 . at least 2,466 people globally are confirmed to have been handed the sentence last year , an increase of 28 % compared with 2013 . the report notes that the spike in sentencing is attributable to mass-sentencing in countries including egypt and nigeria , `` against scores of people in some cases . '' the organization found `` positive developments '' worldwide , with most regions seeming to show reductions in the number of executions . opinion : sharp spike in death sentences . sub-saharan africa , for example , saw a 28 % fall in reported cases , and executions recorded in the middle east and north africa were down 23 % compared to 2013 . `` even though we 've highlighted some of the negative developments ... i think we would always highlight that there are positive developments , '' gaughran said . `` across the board , with the exception of europe and central asia there were fewer reports of executions in every region . '' the resumption of the use of capital punishment in belarus -- the only country in europe and central asia to execute people -- after a two year hiatus spoiled an near-universal decrease in countries using the death penalty by region . the united states has the dubious distinction of being the only country in the americas to conduct executions , but the number of convicts put to death here fell slightly , from 39 in 2013 to 35 in 2014 . the state of washington also imposed a moratorium on executions last year . the u.s. remains one of the worst offenders for imposing capital punishment , with only iran -lrb- 289 + -rrb- , iraq -lrb- 61 + -rrb- , and saudi arabia -lrb- 90 + -rrb- executing more people in 2014 . while figures are not available , amnesty estimates that china also executes `` thousands '' of prisoners each year , `` more than the rest of the world put together . '' the report also highlights the imperfections in the judiciary processes that lead to many sentenced to death . `` in the majority of countries where people were sentenced to death or executed , the death penalty was imposed after proceedings that did not meet international fair trial standards , '' the report stated . `` in 2014 amnesty international raised particular concerns in relation to court proceedings in afghanistan , bangladesh , china , egypt , iran , iraq , north korea , pakistan , saudi arabia and sri lanka . '' the united nations secretary-general , ban ki-moon , last year stressed the need to move toward abolition of capital punishment . `` the taking of life is too irreversible for one human being to inflict it on another , '' he said , in marking world day against death penalty in october . `` we must continue to argue strongly that the death penalty is unjust and incompatible with fundamental human rights . '' amnesty estimates that at least 19,094 people were believed to be on death row at the end of 2014 .\\xc8\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xad#-lrb- cnn -rrb- on may 28 , 2014 , some 7,000 people gathered in a stadium in china 's northwestern xinjiang region . but they had not come to watch the local football team or any other grand sporting event . instead , the authorities paraded scores of prisoners dressed in orange jumpsuits . armed soldiers guarded the exits . in the patently unfair , open air trial that followed , 55 people were found guilty of a range of offenses linked to violent attacks in the region and jailed . three were sentenced to death . the public mass sentencing was part a china 's `` strike hard '' campaign against unrest in xinjiang , a campaign the government claims was launched to combat `` terrorism '' and `` separatism . '' but it was also indicative of a trend that was starkly evident last year around the world -- governments using the death penalty in a misguided , and often cynical , attempt to tackle crime and terrorism . today , amnesty international releases its annual review of the death penalty worldwide . much of it makes for grim reading . in pakistan , the government lifted a six-year moratorium on the execution of civilians in the wake of the horrific taliban attack on a school in peshawar in december . more than 60 people have been put to death since , and the government has threatened to send thousands more death row prisoners to the gallows . iran and iraq executed people for `` terrorism , '' and other countries expanded the scope of capital crimes in their penal codes . in a year when abhorrent summary executions by armed groups were branded on the global consciousness as never before , governments are themselves resorting to more executions in a knee-jerk reaction to terrorism . other countries made use of executions in similarly flawed attempts to address -- or appear to address -- crime rates . jordan ended an eight-year moratorium in december , putting 11 murder convicts to death , with the government saying it was a move to end a surge in violent crime . in indonesia , authorities announced plans to execute mainly drug traffickers to tackle a public safety `` national emergency . '' six people have already been executed this year . a sharp spike in death sentences recorded in 2014 -- up more than 500 on the previous year -- can also be attributed to governments using the death penalty as a political tool . the rise was largely because of developments in egypt and nigeria , where courts imposed hundreds of death sentences in the context of internal political instability or crime and armed conflict . the simple fact is that governments using the death penalty to tackle crime and security threats are deceiving themselves or the public or both . there is no evidence that the threat of execution is more of a deterrent to crime than a prison sentence , as united nations and other studies have repeatedly confirmed . it is high time that world leaders stop using the death penalty as an easy way out when times get tough . at amnesty international , we have campaigned for an end to the death penalty for decades . thankfully , most of the world now appears to agree with us . the numbers speak for themselves . in 1945 when the united nations was founded , only eight countries had abolished the death penalty . today , 140 states are abolitionist in law or practice . last year , we recorded executions in 22 countries , down by almost a half from 20 years ago . despite the troubling developments we recorded last year , there was still much good news to be found . the number of executions recorded around the world dropped significantly in 2014 compared with the previous year , from 778 to 607 . this number does not include china , where more people are put to death than the rest of the world put together , but with death penalty statistics treated as a state secret , the true figure is impossible to determine . executions were recorded in only three countries in sub-saharan africa -- equatorial guinea , somalia and sudan -- and the number of people put to death went down by more than a quarter . the americas continued to be execution-free , apart from the united states . those governments that still execute need to realize that they are on the wrong side of history . they must join the vast majority of countries which have dropped the ultimate cruel punishment . fighting for an end to the death penalty remains an uphill task , but all of us must try to make the world free of this punishment . with determination , i know that we can achieve this goal .\\x92\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' listen to anne frank 's friends describe her concentration camp experience . as the russians advanced further , the bergen-belsen concentration camp became even more crowded , bringing more disease . a deadly typhus outbreak caused thousands to die each day . typhus is an infectious disease caused by lice that breaks out in places with poor hygiene . the disease causes high fever , chills and skin eruptions . `` because of the lice infesting the bedstraw and her clothes , anne was exposed to the main carrier of epidemic typhus for an extended period , '' museum researchers wrote . they concluded that it 's unlikely the sisters survived until march , because witnesses at the camp said the sisters both had symptoms before february 7 . `` most deaths caused by typhus occur around twelve days after the first symptoms appear , '' wrote authors erika prins and gertjan broek . the exact dates of death for anne and margot remain unclear . margot died before anne . `` anne never gave up hope , '' said blitz , her friend . `` she was absolutely convinced she would survive .

      "b\"\\xfc(-lrb- cnn -rrb- the rev. robert h. schuller , california televangelist and founder of the television ministry `` hour of power , '' died thursday , according to his family . he was 88 years old . schuller , also the founder of crystal cathedral megachurch , had been diagnosed with esophageal cancer in august 2013 , a release from `` hour of power '' said . `` my father-in-law passed away peacefully early this morning . he was a great dad and a great man of god , '' said schuller 's daughter-in-law , donna schuller , in a twitter message . schuller 's life followed an almost shakespearean arc . he was born in a iowa farmhouse without running water and longed to preach from his earliest days . in his autobiography , `` prayer : my soul 's adventure with god , '' he described standing alone by a river and picturing himself delivering sermons to a rapt congregation . after attending a hope college and western theological seminary in michigan , he met his wife of more than 60 years , arvella , while preaching at her church -lrb- she was the organist -rrb- . with their young family in tow , the schullers caravanned west to california , where he rented a drive-in theater and preached from the roof of the snack bar . it was beneath the dignity of christian ministry , some local pastors huffed . the `` passion pits '' where teenagers necked was no place for the gospel . schuller was undeterred , and he quickly outgrew the drive-in . he called the explosive growth of his tiny congregation a `` miracle , '' though his many mainstream critics had other names for it . his confident , breezy version of christianity -- too breezy , by some estimations -- drew hordes of seekers and lapsed christians who were put off by the hellfire fulminations of many post-war american preachers . schuller sold a softer , gentler message , which borrowed heavily , he acknowledged , from the father of the feel-good gospel , norman vincent peale . he preached not to convert or condemn people , but to encourage them , a sentiment he called `` possibility thinking . '' people loved it . `` evangelicalism at its best wants to be innovative and reach people , '' said timothy larsen , a professor of christian thought at wheaton college in illinois . `` and schuller was a master at that . '' `` what he got right is that the gospel is good news , '' larsen continued . `` and he preached an uplifting message about personal transformation and uplift and hope . '' some of schuller 's favored phrases , though , struck others as cornpone christianity . `` turn your hurt into a halo ? '' said randall balmer , a professor of american religious history at dartmouth college , citing one such phrase . `` that 's pretty weak tea . '' still , balmer gives schuller some credit . `` it may be bad theology , but it 's brilliant marketing . '' in 1970 , schuller began broadcasting `` hour of power , '' believed to be one of the first , if not the very first , sunday service to be shown regularly on television . with his genial smile , priestly robes and gray hair , he looked and talked like a guy who wanted nothing more than to see his flock succeed . the show , which ran for decades , reached millions , making schuller a televangelist before the term became tarnished by the sins of his many successors . schuller 's crowning achievement , at least architecturally , still stands in orange county , california , though it is now owned by the roman catholic church . the crystal cathedral , a great gleaming edifice with 10,000 glass panels , gave worshipers a look at the clouds that house the heavens , while schuller preached in the pulpit below . the message was clear to many : the road to the former ran through the latter . during the 1980s and 1990s , schuller 's star continued to rise , with presidents stopping by the crystal cathedral -- often during campaigns , it should be said -- and future megachurch pastors like rick warren and bill hybels seeking his advice . as schuller aged , though , his family was beset by a succession scandal straight from the pages of `` king lear . '' he tried to install his only son , bobby jr. , as pastor of crystal cathedral . but the preaching styles of father and son were too different for the congregation -- measured at times at 10,000 strong -- to countenance . bobby schuller jr. left `` hour of power '' and the pulpit at crystal cathedral after a short time . as the family searched for a new successor and tussled over finances , viewers and donations to the church and its television show dropped precipitously . crystal cathedral ministries filed for bankruptcy in 2010 , citing debts of more than $ 43 million , according to the associated press . schuller 's empire , which once soared as high as his glassy cathedral , had fallen to dust . eventually , schuller 's grandson , also named bobby , took over `` hour of power , '' though at a different church . in a statement on thursday , the younger schuller recalled standing atop crystal cathedral 's 12-story tower of hope with his grandfather as they surveyed the surrounding landscape . `` you could see the whole world from there , '' he said . people we 've lost in 2015 . cnn 's stella chan reported from los angeles .\\x8f\\n\"\n",

'' theia is only one year old but the dog 's brush with death did not leave her unscathed . she suffered a dislocated jaw , leg injuries and a caved-in sinus cavity -- and still requires surgery to help her breathe . the veterinary hospital 's good samaritan fund committee awarded some money to help pay for the dog 's treatment , but mellado has set up a fundraising page to help meet the remaining cost of the dog 's care . she 's also created a facebook page to keep supporters updated . donors have already surpassed the $ 10,000 target , inspired by theia 's tale of survival against the odds . on the fundraising page , mellado writes , `` she is in desperate need of extensive medical procedures to fix her nasal damage and reset her jaw . i agreed to foster her until she finally found a loving home . '' she is dedicated to making sure theia gets the medical attention she needs , mellado adds , and wants to `` make sure she gets placed in a family where this will never happen to her again !

      "b\"\\xba!-lrb- cnn -rrb- if you 've been following the news lately , there are certain things you doubtless know about mohammad javad zarif . he is , of course , the iranian foreign minister . he has been u.s. secretary of state john kerry 's opposite number in securing a breakthrough in nuclear discussions that could lead to an end to sanctions against iran -- if the details can be worked out in the coming weeks . and he received a hero 's welcome as he arrived in iran on a sunny friday morning . `` long live zarif , '' crowds chanted as his car rolled slowly down the packed street . you may well have read that he is `` polished '' and , unusually for one burdened with such weighty issues , `` jovial . '' an internet search for `` mohammad javad zarif '' and `` jovial '' yields thousands of results . he certainly has gone a long way to bring iran in from the cold and allow it to rejoin the international community . but there are some facts about zarif that are less well-known . here are six : . in september 2013 , zarif tweeted `` happy rosh hashanah , '' referring to the jewish new year . that prompted christine pelosi , the daughter of house minority leader nancy pelosi , to respond with a tweet of her own : `` thanks . the new year would be even sweeter if you would end iran 's holocaust denial , sir . '' and , perhaps to her surprise , pelosi got a response . `` iran never denied it , '' zarif tweeted back . `` the man who was perceived to be denying it is now gone . happy new year . '' the reference was likely to former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who had left office the previous month . zarif was nominated to be foreign minister by ahmadinejad 's successor , hassan rouhami . his foreign ministry notes , perhaps defensively , that `` due to the political and security conditions of the time , he decided to continue his education in the united states . '' that is another way of saying that he was outside the country during the demonstrations against the shah of iran , which began in 1977 , and during the iranian revolution , which drove the shah from power in 1979 . zarif left the country in 1977 , received his undergraduate degree from san francisco state university in 1981 , his master 's in international relations from the university of denver in 1984 and his doctorate from the university of denver in 1988 . both of his children were born in the united states . the website of the iranian foreign ministry , which zarif runs , can not even agree with itself on when he was born . the first sentence of his official biography , perhaps in a nod to the powers that be in tehran , says zarif was `` born to a religious traditional family in tehran in 1959 . '' later on the same page , however , his date of birth is listed as january 8 , 1960 . and the iranian diplomacy website says he was born in in 1961 . so he is 54 , 55 or maybe even 56 . whichever , he is still considerably younger than his opposite number , kerry , who is 71 . the feds investigated him over his alleged role in controlling the alavi foundation , a charitable organization . the u.s. justice department said the organization was secretly run on behalf of the iranian government to launder money and get around u.s. sanctions . but last year , a settlement in the case , under which the foundation agreed to give a 36-story building in manhattan along with other properties to the u.s. government , did not mention zarif 's name . early in the iranian revolution , zarif was among the students who took over the iranian consulate in san francisco . the aim , says the website iranian.com -- which cites zarif 's memoirs , titled `` mr. ambassador '' -- was to expel from the consulate people who were not sufficiently islamic . later , the website says , zarif went to make a similar protest at the iranian mission to the united nations . in response , the iranian ambassador to the united nations offered him a job . in fact , he has now spent more time with kerry than any other foreign minister in the world . and that amount of quality time will only increase as the two men , with help from other foreign ministers as well , try to meet a june 30 deadline for nailing down the details of the agreement they managed to outline this week in switzerland .K\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x99,los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's more than just one state 's internal problem . the historic california drought hurts the rest of the union , too . that 's because california is a breadbasket to the nation , growing more than a third of its vegetables and nearly two-thirds of its fruits and nuts . here 's why we should heed the ongoing drought in the most populous state , a slowly expanding natural disaster now in its fourth year that this week prompted gov. jerry brown to announce a mandatory 25 % cutback in water consumption in all cities . in 2014 , one expert predicted consumers would pay more for some groceries because of the california drought . he was often right , according to statistics gathered by timothy richards , agribusiness professor at arizona state university . prices rose last year for these items on your kitchen table : . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 berries rose in price by about 80 cents per clamshell to $ 3.88 . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 broccoli by 11 cents per pound to $ 1.89 . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 grapes by 64 cents a pound to $ 3.06 . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 melons by 24 cents a pound to $ 1.23 . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 packaged salad by 23 cents a bag to $ 2.91 . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 peppers by 26 cents a pound to $ 2.39 . though fruits and vegetable prices fell in february , overall prices are expected to rise this year , because of inflation , u.s. department of agriculture economist annemarie kuhns said . fresh fruit prices are projected to rise between 2.5 % and 3.5 % , and vegetables between 2 % and 3 % , close to historical average increases , kuhns said . whether the california drought will affect food prices again this year is unknown , thanks to a strong dollar . the greenback 's strength allows producers to import crops that may be withering under the absence of west coast rain or other misfortunes elsewhere in the nation , kuhns said . moreover , the drop in oil prices also eases the cost of transporting food from california to the other 49 states , she said . what economists do n't know yet is whether farmers will plant fewer crops because of the drought . those decisions are now being made in the field and could boost supermarket prices , she said . `` the drought in california does have the potential to impact the price we pay for fresh fruit and fresh vegetables and dairy and fresh eggs we pay at the counter , '' kuhns said . `` we are not sure what the exact impact will be . '' the reality is there 's a major drought throughout the west and southwest . while not as bad as california , texas and oklahoma are also seeing extreme and exceptional drought -- the two worst categories -- in several parts of their states , the u.s. drought monitor said this week . overall , the western drought affects more than 52 million people , the monitor says . as a result , consumers paid a whopping extra 12.1 % for beef and veal in 2014 , the usda reports . straining under a drought that began in 2012 , ranchers in texas and oklahoma last year saw smaller grazing pastures , paid more for feed , and experienced difficulties accessing water to cool their cattle . so the cattlemen began culling their herds , kuhns said . this year 's beef and veal prices should rise only by 6 % at most , still higher than the 4.1 % historical average , the feds project . but beef prices offer an object lesson about the drought . `` there 's other areas being affected , '' kuhns said . it 's called the golden state for the gold rush of yore , but let 's face it : the rest of the nation flocks to california for vacation because of another golden reason . its year-round sunshine . so the next time you take a holiday in california , you 'll find a few changes around here , thanks to the drought . like asking for a glass of water at a restaurant . you wo n't find water waiting for you on the table . eateries now `` can only serve water to customers on request , '' the state water resources control board declared in march under expanded emergency regulations . tourists can also expect to hear a lot of requests at hotels about whether they want their linens and towels laundered daily . these requests are mandatory under the new regulations . and they 'll see fewer homes running decorative fountains . because much of the snowpack in the sierra nevada has alarmingly disappeared , many ski resorts shut down early this year , including at lake tahoe , and some are now building zip lines , mountain bike trails and wedding venues to keep tourists coming , the sacramento bee reported . `` if the drought continues through next winter and we do not conserve more , the consequences could be even more catastrophic than they already are , '' state water board chair felicia marcus said in march . but what about those yummy california wines , you ask ? guess what . they 're only getting better -- because of the drought . yes , you read that right . the 2014 wine grape harvest was `` third in a string of great vintages this decade , '' the wine institute says . `` california vintners and growers across the state are grateful for another excellent vintage , despite an ongoing drought and earthquake that rocked south napa in late august just as crush was getting underway , '' the institute said in a statement last year . `` a mild winter and spring caused early bud break , although the overall length of the growing season was similar to past years . '' wine grapes use relatively low water , said institute spokeswoman gladys horiuchi . `` yes , drought years tend to produce terrific quality , '' she added . `` with the record high california wine grape harvests in 2012 , 2013 and 2014 , there is a good supply of california wine . '' that may be the only thing to toast about this drought .\\xd0\\x1b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc54-lrb- cnn -rrb- as goes walmart , so goes the nation ? everyone from apple ceo tim cook to the head of the ncaa slammed religious freedom laws being considered in several states this week , warning that they would open the door to discrimination against gay and lesbian customers . but it was the opposition from walmart , the ubiquitous retailer that dots the american landscape , that perhaps resonated most deeply , providing the latest evidence of growing support for gay rights in the heartland . walmart 's staunch criticism of a religious freedom law in its home state of arkansas came after the company said in february it would boost pay for about 500,000 workers well above the federal minimum wage . taken together , the company is emerging as a bellwether for shifting public opinion on hot-button political issues that divide conservatives and liberals . and some prominent republicans are urging the party to take notice . former minnesota gov. tim pawlenty , who famously called on the gop to `` be the party of sam 's club , not just the country club , '' told cnn that walmart 's actions `` foreshadow where the republican party will need to move . '' `` the republican party will have to better stand for '' ideas on helping the middle class , said pawlenty , the head of the financial services roundtable , a washington lobbying group for the finance industry . the party 's leaders must be `` willing to put forward ideas that will help modest income workers , such as a reasonable increase in the minimum wage , and prohibit discrimination in things such as jobs , housing , public accommodation against gays and lesbians . '' walmart , which employs more than 50,000 people in arkansas , emerged victorious on wednesday . hours after the company 's ceo , doug mcmillon , called on republican gov. asa hutchinson to veto the bill , the governor held a news conference and announced he would not sign the legislation unless its language was fixed . walmart 's opposition to the religious freedom law once again puts the company at odds with many in the republican party , which the company 's political action committee has tended to support . in 2004 , the walmart pac gave around $ 2 million to republicans versus less than $ 500,000 to democrats , according to data from the center for responsive politics . that gap has grown less pronounced in recent years . in 2014 , the pac spent about $ 1.3 million to support republicans and around $ 970,000 for democrats . it has been a gradual transformation for walmart . in 2011 , the company bulked up its nondiscrimination policies by adding protections for gender identity . two years later , the company announced that it would start offering health insurance benefits to same-sex partners of employees starting in 2014 . retail experts say walmart 's evolution on these issues over the years is partly a reflection of its diverse consumer base , as well as a recognition of the country 's increasingly progressive views of gay equality -lrb- support for same-sex marriage is at a new high of 59 % , according to a recent wall street journal/nbc news poll -rrb- . `` it 's easy for someone like a chick-fil-a to take a really polarizing position , '' said dwight hill , a partner at the retail consulting firm mcmillandoolittle . `` but in the world of the largest retailer in the world , that 's very different . '' hill added : same-sex marriage , `` while divisive , it 's becoming more common place here within the u.s. , and the businesses by definition have to follow the trend of their customer . '' the backlash over the religious freedom measures in indiana and arkansas this week is shining a bright light on the broader business community 's overwhelming support for workplace policies that promote gay equality . after indiana gov. mike pence , a republican , signed his state 's religious freedom bill into law , ceos of companies big and small across the country threatened to pull out of the hoosier state . the resistance came from business leaders of all political persuasions , including bill oesterle , ceo of the business-rating website angie 's list and a one-time campaign manager for former indiana gov. mitch daniels . oesterle announced that his company would put plans on hold to expand its footprint in indianapolis in light of the state 's passage of the religious freedom act . nascar , scheduled to hold a race in indianapolis this summer , also spoke out against the indiana law . `` what we 're seeing over the past week is a tremendous amount of support from the business community who are standing up and are sending that equality is good for business and discrimination is bad for business , '' said jason rahlan , spokesman for the human rights campaign . the debate has reached presidential politics . national republicans are being forced to walk the fine line of protecting religious liberties and supporting nondiscrimination . likely gop presidential candidate jeb bush initially backed indiana 's religious freedom law and pence , but moderated his tone a few days later . the former florida governor said wednesday that indiana could have taken a `` better '' and `` more consensus-oriented approach . '' `` by the end of the week , indiana will be in the right place , '' bush said , a reference to pence 's promise this week to fix his state 's law in light of the widespread backlash . others in the gop field are digging in . sen. ted cruz of texas , the only officially declared republican presidential candidate , said wednesday that he had no interest in second-guessing pence and lashed out at the business community for opposing the law . `` i think it is unfortunate that large companies today are listening to the extreme left wing agenda that is driven by an aggressive gay marriage agenda , '' cruz said . meanwhile , former secretary of state hillary clinton , who previously served on walmart 's board of directors , called on hutchinson to veto the arkansas bill , saying it would `` permit unfair discrimination '' against the lgbt community . jay chesshir , ceo of the little rock regional chamber of commerce in arkansas , welcomed hutchinson 's pledge on wednesday to seek changes to his state 's bill . he said businesses are not afraid to wade into a politically controversial debate to ensure inclusive workplace policies . `` when it comes to culture and quality of life , businesses are extremely interested in engaging in debate simply because it impacts its more precious resource -- and that 's its people , '' chesshir said . `` therefore , when issues arise that have negative or positive impact on those things , then the business community will again speak and speak loudly .

      "b\"\\xcc--lrb- cnn -rrb- a year ago bloomberg published a story with the following headline : mike pence , a koch favorite , mulls 2016 run for president . the story ticked off items on pence 's conservative things-to-do list while also noting his close ties to the deep-pocketed koch brothers , as well as other right-wing lobbying groups . last august the indiana governor was in dallas for an americans for prosperity event ; the group is backed by the conservative koch brothers , and supported gov. pence 's tax-slashing budget . now , pence is drawing huge heat for his controversial decision to sign a religious freedom law last week that opens the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians . why would pence ignore the pleas of indiana 's chamber of commerce as well as the republican mayor of his state capital and sign such a bill ? because there 's a very powerful wing of his party that wants a conservative as its 2016 candidate and this bill was pence 's way of shoring up his street cred . it is also the reason why republican jeb bush , pence 's fellow white house hopeful , who is viewed as a little light in that category , was first to rush in to defend pence and the law . one lesson here : just because more than 70 % of the country now lives in states where same-sex marriage is legal does not mean 70 % of the country is happy about it . backlash aside , the fact is pence has scored a lot of points this week among ultraconservatives . and while that may not be enough to get him over this political hump , the very public debate that now embroils him -- and arkansas gov. asa hutchinson , and likely 14 other states considering similar proposals this year -- is more than enough to drag the entire republican field farther to the right than the party had hoped . pence : ` was i expecting this kind of backlash ? heavens no . ' for there is no way a republican can get through the pending primary without denouncing lgbt rights , which unfortunately will turn numerous americans into single-issue voters . i foolishly hoped the issue of lgbt rights would be a bit player in the 2016 general election , overshadowed by foreign policy and the economy . instead it looks like it 's going to be dragged down to a replay of pat buchanan 's `` cultural war '' speech , during which he told the 1992 republican national convention : `` we stand with -lrb- george h.w. bush -rrb- against the amoral idea that gay and lesbian couples should have the same standing in law as married men and women '' and later followed with `` there is a religious war going on in this country . it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the cold war itself . for this war is for the soul of america . '' progressives may enjoy watching pence 's temporary fall from grace , but his policy rhetoric has echoed that of 2016 hopeful sen. ted cruz of texas , who has indicated a federal ban on same-sex marriage is not off the gop table . and even if you think neither pence nor bush nor cruz will win the nomination , someone has to . in light of that , listen to conservative former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , a potential 2016 candidate describing conservatives ' discomfort with same-sex marriage : `` it 's like asking someone who 's jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli . '' or louisiana gov. bobby jindal : `` i certainly will support ted cruz and others that are talking about making ... a constitutional amendment to allow states to continue to define marriage . '' or wisconsin gov. scott walker , who has a long history of fighting against same-sex marriage and civil unions . and ben carson said jail turns people gay , so there 's that . remember : pence did n't act alone . he only signed a bill that first passed muster with other elected officials . in fact , according to the american civil liberties union , `` the indiana rfra -lsb- religious freedom restoration act -rsb- is one of 24 introduced in 15 states this year that could allow someone to use their religious beliefs to discriminate . numerous other bills specifically single out the lgbt community for unequal treatment . '' who supports , denounces indiana law ? gallup polls may suggest voters nationwide are more gay-friendly , but the trend on the state level tells a different story . perhaps we 're witnessing the final gasp of long-ago biases . or maybe those biases are having a rebirth we had underestimated . former rep. barney frank of massachusetts , the first member of congress to marry someone of the same sex while in office , said he believes republicans want the supreme court to rule in favor of same-sex marriage to provide political cover in the gop primary . `` we 're winning , '' he told a crowd in chicago recently while promoting his latest book . i guess if you look at where the country was on lgbt issues 10 years ago , we definitely are . that 's assuming you are part of the `` we '' who believe lgbt people should have the same rights as their heterosexual/cisgender counterparts . but as the situation in indiana has shown , `` winning '' should not be mistaken for having `` won . '' for it is doubtful that a candidate will be able to avoid taking a position on the wave of so-called `` religious freedom '' bills snaking through red-state legislatures . or to sidestep the topic of a constitutional amendment when it 's raised in a debate or at a campaign stop , especially with republicans controlling both the house and the senate . pence , and to a lesser extent , jeb bush , may be toxic now but america has a short attention span . more importantly , they are not alone . frank said when progressives get angry they march in the streets , and when conservatives get mad they march to the polls . if that holds true in 2016 , `` winning '' is going to feel very strange .\\xcf\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' then there was the issue of food . the fish were n't cooperating , but after a while jordan learned they were attracted to his laundry , which he would put out to sea for a rinse . the fish would swim in and out of his clothes and he could easily scoop them up with a hand net , he said . jordan came ashore thursday evening . cnn affiliate wavy in norfolk , virginia , reported that he was able to walk from the helicopter into sentara norfolk general hospital about 7:30 p.m. coast guard officials have said they have found no reason to doubt jordan 's incredible story . they noted that his father contacted them january 29 to report his son and his boat missing . frank jordan addressed the skepticism about his son 's appearance , saying the boat stayed afloat and upright most of the time . his son spent most of his days in the cabin , out of the sun . frank jordan said it was obvious when the jordans met at the hospital friday morning that his normally low-key and private son had been through an ordeal . `` i know he went through what he went through , '' frank jordan said . jordan is an unemployed truck driver who lived on his boat at a marina in conway . he had free rent and free food in the river , he said . but when it became difficult to catch dinner , he took off for the ocean in hopes he would land some bigger fish . frank jordan told cnn 's wolf blitzer on thursday that he had worried about his son , who is an inexperienced sailor , but he held hope because his son had a good boat . and he had the strength to make it . `` he 's got a very strong constitution and -lrb- is strong -rrb- not only physically , but spiritually , '' frank jordan said . `` and he told me on the phone that he was praying the whole time , so i believe that sustained him a great deal . '' rescue swimmer kyle mccollum was the first to care for jordan on the flight back to land . `` you would expect sunburns , severe sunburn , blisters maybe ... a bunch of medical issues that could possibly be wrong with him , '' he said . `` but for him to be in his current state was pretty amazing . '' grenz was also surprised by jordan 's condition , physically and mentally . the rescued sailor knew almost exactly what day it was , remarkable for someone who had been on the water for more than 60 days . jordan was dehydrated and said he was hungry . `` we took him to a rescue boat , '' the container ship captain said . `` he was given water and pea soup to gain some power again . '' derriel morris , a neighbor at the bucksport plantation marina & rv resort called jordan a nice guy who loved his 47-year-old boat , named `` angel . '' morris said : `` it was immaculate , it was gorgeous , beautifully painted . i mean it looked like a brand new sailboat . '' morris told cnn affiliate wpde that one day in january he was going to the store and jordan asked him to bring back some coffee creamer . but when he returned to the marina , jordan had slipped away . `` there was no shore line , no hose ; it was like he was never there , '' morris told the station . after he disappeared others who also live there held a candlelight ceremony . the marina 's manager , jeff weeks , told wpde that jordan is expected to be back at buscksport next week . tales of people who cheated death after days , weeks adrift .}\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x96\\x17-lrb- cnn -rrb- paul walker is hardly the first actor to die during a production . but walker 's death in november 2013 at the age of 40 after a car crash was especially eerie given his rise to fame in the `` fast and furious '' film franchise . the release of `` furious 7 '' on friday offers the opportunity for fans to remember -- and possibly grieve again -- the man that so many have praised as one of the nicest guys in hollywood . `` he was a person of humility , integrity , and compassion , '' military veteran kyle upham said in an email to cnn . walker secretly paid for the engagement ring upham shopped for with his bride . `` we did n't know him personally but this was apparent in the short time we spent with him . i know that we will never forget him and he will always be someone very special to us , '' said upham . the actor was on break from filming `` furious 7 '' at the time of the fiery accident , which also claimed the life of the car 's driver , roger rodas . producers said early on that they would not kill off walker 's character , brian o'connor , a former cop turned road racer . instead , the script was rewritten and special effects were used to finish scenes , with walker 's brothers , cody and caleb , serving as body doubles . there are scenes that will resonate with the audience -- including the ending , in which the filmmakers figured out a touching way to pay tribute to walker while `` retiring '' his character . at the premiere wednesday night in hollywood , walker 's co-star and close friend vin diesel gave a tearful speech before the screening , saying `` this movie is more than a movie . '' `` you 'll feel it when you see it , '' diesel said . `` there 's something emotional that happens to you , where you walk out of this movie and you appreciate everyone you love because you just never know when the last day is you 're gon na see them . '' there have been multiple tributes to walker leading up to the release . diesel revealed in an interview with the `` today '' show that he had named his newborn daughter after walker . social media has also been paying homage to the late actor . a week after walker 's death , about 5,000 people attended an outdoor memorial to him in los angeles . most had never met him . marcus coleman told cnn he spent almost $ 1,000 to truck in a banner from bakersfield for people to sign at the memorial . `` it 's like losing a friend or a really close family member ... even though he is an actor and we never really met face to face , '' coleman said . `` sitting there , bringing his movies into your house or watching on tv , it 's like getting to know somebody . it really , really hurts . '' walker 's younger brother cody told people magazine that he was initially nervous about how `` furious 7 '' would turn out , but he is happy with the film . `` it 's bittersweet , but i think paul would be proud , '' he said . cnn 's paul vercammen contributed to this report .J\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf4'-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states and its negotiating partners reached a very strong framework agreement with iran in lausanne , switzerland , on thursday that limits iran 's nuclear program in such a way as to effectively block it from building a nuclear weapon . expect pushback anyway , if the recent past is any harbinger . just last month , in an attempt to head off such an agreement , house speaker john boehner invited israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu to preemptively blast it before congress , and 47 senators sent a letter to the iranian leadership warning them away from a deal . the debate that has already begun since the announcement of the new framework will likely result in more heat than light . it will not be helped by the gathering swirl of dubious assumptions and doubtful assertions . let us address some of these : . the most misleading assertion , despite universal rejection by experts , is that the negotiations ' objective at the outset was the total elimination of any nuclear program in iran . that is the position of netanyahu and his acolytes in the u.s. congress . but that is not and never was the objective . if it had been , there would have been no iranian team at the negotiating table . rather , the objective has always been to structure an agreement or series of agreements so that iran could not covertly develop a nuclear arsenal before the united states and its allies could respond . the new framework has exceeded expectations in achieving that goal . it would reduce iran 's low-enriched uranium stockpile , cut by two-thirds its number of installed centrifuges and implement a rigorous inspection regime . another dubious assumption of opponents is that the iranian nuclear program is a covert weapons program . despite sharp accusations by some in the united states and its allies , iran denies having such a program , and u.s. intelligence contends that iran has not yet made the decision to build a nuclear weapon . iran 's continued cooperation with international atomic energy agency inspections is further evidence on this point , and we 'll know even more about iran 's program in the coming months and years because of the deal . in fact , the inspections provisions that are part of this agreement are designed to protect against any covert action by the iranians . what 's more , the rhetoric of some members of congress has implied that the negotiations have been between only the united states and iran -lrb- i.e. , the 47 senators ' letter warning that a deal might be killed by congress or a future president -rrb- . this of course is not the case . the talks were between iran and the five permanent members of the u.n. security council -lrb- united states , united kingdom , france , china and russia -rrb- plus germany , dubbed the p5 +1 . while the united states has played a leading role in the effort , it negotiated the terms alongside its partners . if the agreement reached by the p5 +1 is rejected by congress , it could result in an unraveling of the sanctions on iran and threaten nato cohesion in other areas . another questionable assertion is that this agreement contains a sunset clause , after which iran will be free to do as it pleases . again , this is not the case . some of the restrictions on iran 's nuclear activities , such as uranium enrichment , will be eased or eliminated over time , as long as 15 years . but most importantly , the framework agreement includes iran 's ratification of the additional protocol , which allows iaea inspectors expanded access to nuclear sites both declared and nondeclared . this provision will be permanent . it does not sunset . thus , going forward , if iran decides to enrich uranium to weapons-grade levels , monitors will be able to detect such a move in a matter of days and alert the u.n. security council . many in congress have said that the agreement should be a formal treaty requiring the senate to `` advise and consent . '' but the issue is not suited for a treaty . treaties impose equivalent obligations on all signatories . for example , the new start treaty limits russia and the united states to 1,550 deployed strategic warheads . but any agreement with iran will not be so balanced . the restrictions and obligations in the final framework agreement will be imposed almost exclusively on iran . the p5 +1 are obligated only to ease and eventually remove most but not all economic sanctions , which were imposed as leverage to gain this final deal . finally some insist that any agreement must address iranian missile programs , human rights violations or support for hamas or hezbollah . as important as these issues are , and they must indeed be addressed , they are unrelated to the most important aim of a nuclear deal : preventing a nuclear iran . to include them in the negotiations would be a poison pill . this agreement should be judged on its merits and on how it affects the security of our negotiating partners and allies , including israel . those judgments should be fact-based , not based on questionable assertions or dubious assumptions .?\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' nasa says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year , but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row , known as a `` tetrad . '' the first was on april 15 , 2014 . the second was in september 2014 , the next is saturday and there will be one more , on september 28 . if you want to learn more about the eclipse , nasa astronomer mitzi adams will take questions on twitter @nasa_marshall . did you see the total lunar eclipse ? share your photos with cnn ireport .t\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' but , in real life , it 's hard to swallow the idea of a single person being stranded at sea for days , weeks , if not months and somehow living to talk about it . miracles do happen , though , and not just in hollywood . we 're not talking about people who float aimlessly or run aground after running out of gas or being let down by faltering winds only to be picked up a few hours later by the u.s. coast guard . much rarer are cases in which individuals become lost at sea long enough that they run out of whatever food and drinking water they 'd brought aboard , if any . in order to survive , they ca n't bank on technology or the proximity of a nearby city , town or boat -- but instead must rely on ingenuity , resourcefulness and luck . it 's hard to say how many of these types of stories end sadly , with a sailor dying at sea , except that it is a much higher number than those that end in rescues . such happy endings do occur -- given what rescue agencies have reported and assuming you believe what any sole survivor says , a big qualifier since typically no one else can prove or refute their accounts . below are a few recent examples : . louis jordan says that he set off on his 35-foot sailboat from south carolina in late january . he headed into the gulf stream looking for a good spot to catch fish . and then everything -- his boat , his life -- turned upside down . rescued man says he is ` utterly thankful ' not only did his boat capsize , but its mast broke , jordan said . and so , too , did his shoulder . he bought time by rationing water , then collecting fresh water in a bucket . as to food , jordan says he used laundry to trap and scoop up fish . and he rigged a makeshift mast and sail . but , jordan said , `` it took so long . it moved so slowly . '' his sailboat would capsize two more times before crew members on a german-flagged container ship , the houston express , spotted jordan about 200 miles off the north carolina coast on thursday . after their reunion , his father greeted him with a hug and an admission every parent dreads . `` i thought i lost you . '' jose salvador alvarenga says his journey began in paredon viejo , a port on mexico 's pacific coast , in late 2012 . the exact date is up for debate -- he says he set off in december , locals say it was november . but what 's not in doubt is that , after he left , he disappeared . until january 2013 . that 's when alvarenga interacted with humans once again , thousands of miles away on a remote atoll in the marshall islands . castaway recounts how he survived over a year adrift in pacific . what was supposed to be a one-day trip , he says , turned into an arduous odyssey across the pacific ocean , one that saw him lose his fishing companion and tested his will and ability to survive . his nightmare began when winds blew the pair off course . then a storm hit causing their boat , which was about three people long and one wide , to lose its engine and use of its radio communication and gps systems . four weeks in , alvarenga said his partner -- 23-year-old ezequiel cordova , according to the boat 's owner -- died because he refused to eat raw birds . the days , weeks and months ran together after that . alvarenga says he drank rainwater and , when there was n't any available , his own urine . he ate sea turtles . then , after 13 or 14 months adrift , he and his small , heavily damaged boat arrived on the ebon atoll , about a 22-hour boat ride from the marshall islands capital of majuro . the atoll has one phone line , no internet service and a few residents , two of whom alvarenga spotted and shouted to after spending a night in the woods . the el salvador native told cnn that his faith in god helped him survive . `` i thought , ' i am going to get out , '' he said . `` get out , get out , get out . '' some in their late 60s might relax in their retirement , reining it in a few notches as life slows down . and if you live in hawaii , there 's even more reason to take it easy . the thing is : ron ingraham is n't one of those people . he 's a fisherman . the sea is both his life and livelihood , his son , zakary , told cnn . and he 's tough , with his son jokingly comparing him to rambo . still , even the hardiest fishermen would have been tested by what ron ingraham went through after setting off around last thanksgiving solo from the hawaiian island of molokai . son vindicated as father rescued after 12 days at sea . after bad weather hit , ron ingraham told cnn affiliate khnl/kgmb that his 25-foot sailboat went `` backwards all night long . '' at one point , a huge wave struck -- pushing his mast into the water and him as well . the 67-year-old used a rope to pull himself back in . but his boat could n't be rescued so easily , leaving him at the mercy of the current . a distress call went out , prompting a search that would cover 12,000 square miles . when a coast guard official told him the search was being called off december 1 , zakary ingraham responded , `` i do n't feel like he 's dead . i do n't feel it . '' he was right . twelve days after that first distress call , ron ingraham was picked up about 64 miles -lrb- 103 kilometers -rrb- south of honolulu `` weak , hungry and dehydrated '' and -- most importantly -- alive . the veteran fisherman headed back to shore only after getting assurances his damaged boat would come with him . in february 2012 , two friends asked 18-year-old adrian vasquez whether he wanted to tag along on an overnight fishing expedition . he said yes , and the three set off from the panama town of san carlos on a small boat , vasquez 's mother , nilsa de la cruz , recalled . things started out well , by all accounts . the three caught plenty of fish . then , their boat 's engine died without warning . and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , the trio did n't know what to do , according to vasquez 's mother . mother calls panama teen 's return ' a miracle ' vazquez ate raw fish and drank rainwater as currents swept his boat , the fifty cents , further and further from the coast and into the pacific ocean . somewhere along the way , his two companions died . it 's not clear exactly how , with ecuadorian rear . adm. freddy garcia calle saying vasquez threw their bodies into the sea `` because they had become badly decomposed . '' some 26 days after and nearly 600 miles away from where the journey began , fishermen spotted the tiny vessel north of the galapagos islands . the ecuadorian navy came in and picked up the teenage survivor , who 'd lost 20 pounds and showed `` severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition , '' according to calle . he returned home to loved ones eager to embrace him , but mindful of giving him time to process the ordeal . `` for us , this is an opportunity to get closer as a family , '' his mother said by phone , `` to be more understanding and loving . '' sometimes one does n't have to be in the ocean for weeks to have his or her life imperiled . sometimes people do n't have to set off by boat to have the sea challenge them to the end . for proof , look no further than hiromitsu shinkawa . 60-year-old man waves red flag to alert rescuers . he was at home on march 11 , 2011 , when a massive 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck 231 miles northeast of tokyo . a devastating tsunami followed , its 30-foot waves ravaging cities and towns and damaging several nuclear reactors . by the time it had run the course , nearly 16,000 people were dead . it 's a miracle shinkawa was n't one of them . shortly after the quake , he and his wife had gone to collect some belongings when the tsunami slammed their hometown of minamisoma . his home was one of the tens of thousands destroyed by the the huge , powerful tsunami wave . `` i was saved by holding onto the roof , '' the 60-year-old said , according to kyodo news agency . `` but my wife was swept away . ' more than two days later , video showed shinkawa barely visible amid heaps of splintered wood , shattered homes and other debris floating more than nine miles -lrb- 15 kilometers -rrb- out to sea . he was waving a self-made red flag . after being spotted by crew aboard a japanese maritime self-defense force destroyer and picked up in a smaller rescue boat , he took a drink offered to him and burst into tears , kyodo reported . shinkawa told his rescuers , `` i thought today was the last day of my life .

      "b\"\\xe7\\x13-lrb- cnn -rrb- since iran 's islamic revolution in 1979 , women have been barred from attending most sports events involving men . but the situation appears set to improve in the coming months after a top iranian sports official said that the ban will be lifted for some events . a plan to allow `` women and families '' to enter sports stadiums will come into effect in the next year , deputy sports minister abdolhamid ahmadi said saturday , according to state-run media . but it is n't clear exactly which games women will be able to attend . according to the state-run press tv , ahmadi said the restrictions would be lifted for indoor sports events . the rules wo n't change for all matches because some sports are mainly related to men and `` families are not interested in attending '' them , press tv cited him as saying . iranian authorities imposed the ban on women attending men 's sports events after the revolution , deeming that mixed crowds watching games together was un-islamic . during the ensuing decades , the crowds at soccer games , iran 's most popular sport , have been all male . iranian women were briefly permitted to attend volleyball matches under the moderate president mohammad khatami , but the ban was reinstated in 2005 after the more hard-line mahmoud ahmadinejad came to power . the iranian government has come under pressure from international sports officials over the restrictions . fifa president sepp blatter called on iran last month to end its `` intolerable '' ban on women attending soccer matches , saying the situation `` can not continue . '' iran had been in the running to host the 2019 edition of soccer 's asian cup , but the tournament was awarded to the united arab emirates . the ban on women attending matches was widely seen as a major impediment to iran 's chances of securing the event . the ban came under the spotlight at the asian cup in australia earlier this year , when thousands of female iranian fans watched their soccer team without restriction . during the match against iraq , activists called for the ban to end and unfurled a banner showing the face of ghoncheh ghavami , a british-iranian woman detained in iran last year while trying to watch a volleyball match . iranian officials have denied that ghavami was arrested for attending the volleyball game , saying she was taken into custody for `` anti-iran activities .

'' `` i think there 's a third alternative , and that is standing firm , ratcheting up the pressure until you get a better deal , '' netanyahu told cnn 's jim acosta sunday on `` state of the union . '' his comments come as democrats and republicans spar over the framework announced last week to lift western sanctions on iran in exchange for the country dropping from 19,000 to 5,060 active centrifuges , limiting its highly enriched uranium , and increasing inspections . president barack obama endorsed the deal , saying it was better than the alternatives . but gop contenders for the party 's 2016 presidential nomination lambasted it , saying it gave iran too much flexibility . on sunday , the sparring continued . one senate democrat said netanyahu needs to `` contain himself . '' and a top republican said almost any of obama 's successors as president `` could do better . '' netanyahu 's most recent argument against the iran nuclear deal was similar to the one he 'd made in a march trip to washington , when he addressed a joint session of congress -- fueling a republican push to have the deal sent to congress before it 's implemented . `` it does not roll back iran 's nuclear program . it keeps a vast nuclear infrastructure in place . not a single centrifuge is destroyed . not a single nuclear facility is shut down , including the underground facilities that they built illicitly . thousands of centrifuges will keep spinning , enriching uranium , '' netanyahu said sunday . `` that 's a very bad deal . '' netanyahu said iran is a country of `` congenital cheating '' and that it ca n't be trusted to abide by the terms of the deal , which lasts 10 years with some provisions extending well beyond that . he said his opposition has little to do with his frosty relationship with obama . `` i think that we can have a legitimate difference of opinion on this , because i think iran has shown to be completely distrustful , '' netanyahu said . democratic sen. dianne feinstein of california , meanwhile , said she wishes netanyahu `` would contain himself . '' the top-ranking democrat on the senate intelligence committee said negotiators working on the deal -- from iran and the united states , as well as russia , china , britain , france and germany -- are `` on the cusp of something that can be workable . '' `` it 's a framework . it has to be wrapped into a final agreement . there still can be some changes , '' feinstein said . `` but i do n't think it 's helpful for israel to come out and oppose this one opportunity to change a major dynamic -- which is downhill , a downhill dynamic in this part of the world . '' energy secretary ernest moniz defended the deal in an appearance on cbs ' `` face the nation '' on sunday , saying it would extend from two months to one year the `` breakout '' time period -- the length of time it would take iran to build a nuclear bomb . he said it also allows for the `` almost instantaneous recognition of any attempt to evade the deal . '' `` we have blocked all of these pathways to a bomb , '' he said . sen. lindsey graham , r-south carolina , said on `` face the nation '' that the best option for the united states is to keep current sanctions in place for two more years and then have a `` new crack at it with a new president that does n't have the baggage of obama . '' and he said the alternatives to obama on both sides -- with the exception of sen. rand paul of kentucky , who 's called for a less active u.s. role overseas -- would likely strike a better deal . `` hillary clinton would do better . i think everybody on our side , except , maybe , rand paul , could do better , '' graham said .2\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xdf2-lrb- cnn -rrb- easter is a cornerstone event in the christian faith , but it 's surrounded by interesting quirks . it celebrates the completion of christ 's mission of salvation in the crucifixion and resurrection . by dying on good friday , christ atoned for the sins of others ; by rising from the grave on sunday , christ conquered death . simple enough and reason for christians to celebrate . but , like christmas with its tree , ornaments and santa claus , easter has picked up its peripheral trappings -- the bunny and colorful eggs . unlike christmas , it does n't fall on the same day every year but shifts around in spring depending upon cosmic events . and that blood moon we just had -- is it pure coincidence that it fell around easter ? -lrb- no . -rrb- . here 's a journey from the vatican to the holy land , around the moon and the earth 's tilting axis , to germany and the united states to try to explain the complex holiday called easter . and you 'll learn to how to color easter eggs with kool-aid . let 's start at the vatican . at the vatican , holy week began with palm sunday last week and culminated in easter sunday mass with multiple celebrations in between to mark the final week of christ 's mortal life . jesus rode on the back of a donkey into jerusalem on palm sunday where crowds celebrated him as the messiah and laid down palm branches in his path . but the crowd and the romans turned on him in the course of the week , according to the bible , leading to his crucifixion and resurrection . rain sprinkled down on worshipers standing under a sea of umbrellas as they gathered in a gray st. peter 's square on sunday to partake in the outdoor services held by pope francis . afterward , the pontiff took a moment to tell the world to do right those in need in his urbi et orbi address . francis lamented the suffering of people in many of the conflicts around the globe . from nigeria to south sudan , iraq to ukraine , he expressed hope that violence would end . francis also does n't put on airs . this week he washed the feet of believers , repeating the biblical account of a woman , a sinner , washing jesus ' feet and anointing them with oil . let 's move on to old jerusalem , the birthplace of easter . the church of the holy sepulcher in old jerusalem unifies the spot where christ was crucified -- calvary -- with his tomb , or sepulcher . on sunday , catholics and armenian christians celebrated the resurrection there . in the morning , the latin patriarch , the archbishop of jerusalem , entered the basilica . then mass was held followed by a procession . but a large group of indigenous christians did n't join them . it 's not quite easter yet in the holy land for eastern orthodox christians . they 'll be celebrating a week from now , because they determine easter 's date by a different calendar than western christians -- the julian calendar . which brings us to the question of how astronomy is used to determine the date of easter sunday . a blood moon appeared in the sky early saturday , right between good friday and easter sunday and during passover . just a coincidence ? not completely , because the dates for both passover -- the jewish holiday celebrating the deliverance from slavery in egypt -- and easter are determined by moon phases , according to timeanddate.com . easter 's timing is related to passover , because jesus was crucified around then , according to the bible . many jewish holidays , including passover , fall on full moon , which is also a prerequisite for a lunar eclipse , the event that turns the moon a blood red color . since the timing of moon phases does n't jibe with earth 's orbit -- which is how we determine the length of a year now -- passover 's exact date moves around -- and so does easter 's . when christian bishops first convened at the council of nicaea in the year 325 , they made a rule to determine the date of easter , so as to fairly reliably pin it to passover : . it would fall on the first sunday after the first full moon following the vernal equinox . that 's the day in march when earth 's axis reaches a midpoint between winter and summer and the day and night are of equal length . but ... if the full moon fell on sunday , easter would be pushed down a week . confusing ? it got worse . when the west moved from the julian calendar to the gregorian calendar , orthodox christians stayed put , resulting in -- usually -- two separate dates for easter . in 1997 , the world council of churches pushed for a unified method of determining a date based on astronomical occurrences . it did n't catch on . but some odd easter trappings that popped up after the middle ages very much have -- the eggs and the bunny . the bunny is an egg-laying pagan that worships the moon . that 's one notion of its origins , but probably not the actual one . german immigrants appear to have brought it to north america in the 1700s . german historians are not clear on its beginnings , but the first known mention of the bunny and the eggs in writing was in 1682 . professor of medicine georg franck von frankenau described in his paper `` de ovis paschalibus , '' or `` on easter eggs , '' a custom in the alsace region involving a bunny and eggs , according to german public television . some also credit the region with inadvertently inventing the christmas tree . but von frankenau left out any explanation of how the tradition arose , leading to a number of theories in germany . one common idea : during lent , people had to abstain from eating eggs , but hens kept on laying them , so farmers boiled and preserved them . by the time easter rolled around , they were practically swimming in them . they had to figure out something to do with them when the holiday hit . play hide and seek with them ; color them ; give them as gifts . parents may have invented the bunny as a playful explanation for children on where the easter eggs came from . if you 're coloring eggs this year , here 's an interesting tip . instead of stinking up your place with the smell of vinegar , use kool-aid , youtube science geek grant thompson suggests . and it appears to work . just use a whole packet in a small glass of hot water and gently lay the eggs in . they turn out as bright as they would in any other food dye . but be careful , it stains everything else , like clothes and upholstery , thompson warns . that 's why your tongue changes colors when you drink it . happy easter ! happy passover !\\xe0\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x901-lrb- cnn -rrb- just as mimeograph machines and photocopiers were in their day , online activity -- blogs , youtube channels , even social media platforms like facebook and twitter -- have fully emerged as the alternative to traditional mainstream media . it is not just the low cost of posting online that attracts dissidence , though that in itself is liberating . it is the lack of access to traditional print and broadcast media in authoritarian countries that is really the driving force leading disaffected voices to post online . it is not unique to asia , but it might seem more pronounced if you live there . going online has become the path of least resistance if you want to make yourself heard . but it still brings resistance , some of it legal , some of it deadly . let 's look at the legal angle first . amos yee , the teenage video blogger who was arrested and held pending bail sunday in singapore , drew international attention for his anti-lee kuan yew harangue . but jailing critics is not usually the government 's first choice in singapore . it is part of lee kuan yew 's legacy that the government 's use of the courts to bring libel and defamation cases , usually carrying heavy financial penalties , is the preferred method of silencing discomfiting online voices . his father has reportedly apologized for his son 's behavior , but the younger yee could face up to three years in jail . yee is not unique . another dissident blogger in singapore , roy ngerng , continues to suffer financial and legal pressure , including the loss of his job , because of a blog post that allegedly accused the city-state 's prime minister , lee hsien loong , of corruption . ngerng 's concern is with the lack of transparency in the management of the central provident fund , the government 's compulsory pension program . yee and ngerng are two of many . the committee to protect journalists ' file on singapore going back to 2000 has a long string of similar cases , some against politicians , others against citizens simply frustrated with their government . but it is not just singapore where internet activity comes under fire : on monday in malaysia , with much less of the international attention heaped on amos yee , five editors and executives from the malaysian insider were arrested over the site 's march 25 report claiming that a senior council of royal rulers and state governors , known as the conference of rulers , had rejected a proposal to amend federal law to allow for the introduction of hudud , or punishments meted out under islamic law . in deeply muslim malaysia , questions of islamic faith are a third-rail issue , as is revealing government decisions before they are announced . by far the biggest jailer of journalists in the world is china , where a majority of the 44 people behind bars at the end of 2014 were bloggers , most of them uighur or tibetan activists who straddle the line between journalism and activism . but in second place in asia is vietnam , where cpj 's most recent prison census showed vietnam holding 16 reporters behind bars as of december 1 . add one more in late december , nguyen dinh ngoc , a prominent blogger who was arrested for `` law-violating '' after police searched his home in southern ho chi minh city on december 27 , and two more in january , nguyen quang lap and hong le tho , arrested on anti-state charges of `` abusing democratic freedoms '' and you can see the pattern . because the print and broadcast media are so totally government controlled , mainstream journalists seldom go to jail any more in vietnam . only two investigative print reporters remain behind bars in vietnam , their cases dating back to 2012 and 2013 . both were accused of accepting bribes for dialing back critical news coverage . the list could go on , but the reality is that , as cpj wrote in 2013 , across asia `` governments have curtailed internet freedoms through increasingly restrictive practices , including prohibitive laws , heightened surveillance and censorship , and threats of imprisonment on various national security-related offenses . '' that is still the policy path being followed by most countries in asia , and it does not look like it will be changing any time soon . jailing journalists is one thing , but watching them being killed and doing little or nothing about it is another . since 1992 , 11 % of journalists killed have died for their work online . because our 1992 start date really precedes the full advent of the internet , that proportion can be expected to grow . while most bloggers have not been the targets of murderers , bangladesh has recently become the exception . on monday , washiqur rahman babu was the second blogger to be hacked to death in public in bangladesh in the past five weeks . blogger avijit roy and his wife , rafida ahmed bonna , were attacked by assailants wielding sharp weapons while the couple was visiting dhaka . roy , a u.s. citizen of bangladeshi origin , was killed and his wife was critically injured . both rahman and roy had written critically on islamic matters . the blogger death toll gets higher in bangladesh if you go back a year or two , and religious beliefs are always involved , and the killings almost always carried out with near perfect impunity . in january 2013 , blogger asif mohiuddin , who wrote critical commentary on religion , islamist groups , free speech , and human rights , barely survived after he was stabbed by islamists . in february 2013 , blogger ahmed rajib haider , who had written about islamic fundamentalism and islamist groups , was hacked to death by members of an islamist militant group , according to police investigations . later in 2013 , islamist groups called for the execution of bloggers they said had committed blasphemy . while arrests were made after those murders , there have been no convictions . the bottom line : online journalists , operating outside the restraints of mainstream media , have become the most vulnerable targets for governments and independent actors . where there is the restrictive rule of law , journalists are vulnerable to the anger of officialdom . where the rule of law is weak , they are vulnerable to the attacks of killers who seldom , if ever , answer to the rule of law .?\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xec:-lrb- cnn -rrb- after years of making the case that the education of athletes is paramount , the ncaa now says it has no legal responsibility to make sure education is actually delivered . on its website , the ncaa prominently states , `` it 's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn , play and succeed . '' and later , it says that `` in the collegiate model of sports , the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first , athletes second . '' but the ncaa is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former university of north carolina athletes . the lawsuit claimed the students did n't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in ncaa history . in its response , the ncaa says it has no legal responsibility `` to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions . '' even with pages of online information about academic standards , and even though the ncaa has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly , ncaa attorneys wrote in this court filing that `` the ncaa did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes , '' and `` the ncaa does not have ` direct , day-to-day , operational control ' '' over member institutions like unc . `` it 's nonsense . it 's double talk , '' said gerald gurney , a former athletic-academic director who is now president of the drake group for academic integrity in collegiate sport . `` if you look at their basic core principles , it 's all about academics , the experience , the integration of academics , and the education of the student is paramount , '' gurney said . `` they seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths . '' the ncaa referred calls for comment to an online statement , which read in part : . the ncaa believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the ncaa 's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the ncaa has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field . `` this case is troubling for a number of reasons , not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the ncaa to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them , '' said donald remy , ncaa chief legal officer . in its response to the lawsuit , it also likened its role to that of the american bar association or american medical association , and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately . the scandal at unc involved thousands of athletes who , over 18 years , were funneled into classes that never met , where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports . mary willingham , the unc whistleblower turned ncaa critic , has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they 're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required . the system of eligibility that the ncaa brags about , she says , is a sham . `` why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we ca n't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway ? it makes no sense , '' said willingham , who recently wrote a book about the unc scandal called `` cheated . '' `` if they ca n't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that , then why certify students semester after semester to play ? it 's lost its meaning for me . '' the ncaa 's claim that it 's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years , not just in the rhetoric on its website , but in speeches by its president , mark emmert , and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes . for example , before it lost a case filed by former ucla player ed o'bannon , suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses , the ncaa stood on the pillar of amateurism , insisting that college athletes are paid with an education . that 's the defense the ncaa is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney jeffrey kessler , seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value . in response , the ncaa said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education : consistent with `` its commitment to amateurism , member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with ncaa bylaws . '' attorney michael hausfeld , who represented both o'bannon and now the unc athletes , said this : . `` this startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the ncaa 's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes . ncaa president mark emmert has repeatedly proposed that ` what we live for is the education of our athletes , ' but the ncaa 's record tells a far different story . '' but rick burton , professor of sport management at syracuse university , said it 's not realistic to think that the ncaa would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country . `` i understand , i think , where the ncaa is coming from . we would not let the ncaa come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at syracuse university , '' he said . `` it sounds like someone is trying to say the ncaa should have been supervising that department at the university of north carolina , and there 's no logic to that , '' he said . `` the people who are saying the ncaa should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the ncaa . '' unc , which was also sued , has admitted to the fraud , but also asked for a judge to throw out the case , saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the `` educational malpractice '' theory does n't apply . unc claims it is protected by state law . this is reminiscent of another ncaa reversal . the ncaa , which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from `` dangerous and exploitive athletic practices , '' now says it does not enforce health and safety rules . in fact , in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011 , the ncaa wrote : `` the ncaa denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes . '' a cnn investigation found that the ncaa has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken . it has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the nfl . ramogi huma , president of the national college players association , and a leading thorn in the ncaa 's side for decades , said this latest backpedaling from the ncaa leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all . `` there 's nothing left the ncaa can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society . one has to wonder what does the ncaa do if it does n't protect players ? if it does n't play a role in the education of college athletics ? it begs the question of why does the ncaa exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption .

      "b\"\\xb7J-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states has seemingly erupted this week about what it means to live your religion , especially in indiana , where its new religious freedom restoration act faces a firestorm from critics who say it uses faith as a pretext to discriminate against gay people . such state laws have been growing ever since the u.s. religious freedom restoration act became law in 1993 , designed to prohibit the federal government from `` substantially burdening '' a person 's exercise of religion . so far , 20 states have some version of the religious liberty law , and the legal controversies have grown , too . nonetheless , claims under those state rfras are `` exceedingly rare , '' and victories involved mostly religious minorities , not christian denominations , experts say . `` there is reason to doubt whether these state-level religious liberty provisions truly provide meaningful protections for religious believers , '' wrote wayne state university law professor christopher lund in a 2010 analysis , when there were only 16 states with such laws . here are some of the more interesting cases arising from the federal and state laws , touching upon an array of religious matters from a knife carried by an irs accountant to a tea from the amazon : . he was a native american with eagle feathers at a religious gathering of tribes . but not in the eyes of the feds . in 2006 , robert soto and michael russell attended an american indian powwow while in possession of eagle feathers , in violation of the federal eagle protection act , which outlaws the killing of bald and golden eagles and even picking their feathers off the ground . soto , a lipan apache , asserted he was participating in an indian religious ceremony . the feathers are sacred to native americans . but a federal fish and wildlife service agent found his tribe was n't federally recognized , and soto surrendered his feathers . russell , who is married to soto 's sister , is n't american indian and agreed to pay a fine , according to court papers and the america bar association journal . soto , however , petitioned the federal interior department to return his feathers . the feds said no , because he was n't from a recognized tribe . soto and russell sued the federal government , but a federal district court ruled in favor of the government , rejecting the two men 's first amendment assertions and their claims under the federal religious freedom restoration act , the same 1993 statute that indiana legislators used in developing their new state law . but last august , the 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals reversed the trial court 's decision and sent the case back to that court after finding the government 's action would violate the federal rfra . on march 10 , the federal government returned the eagle feathers to soto . but the legal war is n't over . the federal government still maintains it can criminally prosecute soto and his congregants , so soto is seeking a preliminary injunction , claiming the feds are violating the federal rfra , said luke goodrich , soto 's attorney who 's with the becket fund for religious liberty . a tea used by a brazilian faith is to them like wine used by catholics at communion , but u.s. agents considered the brew an illegal drug . the religious organization o centro espirita beneficiente uniao do vegetal uses a sacramental tea called hoasca , made from two plants native to the amazon that contains dimethyltryptamine , a hallucinogen , in violation of the controlled substances act . the religion is a christian spiritist faith that originated in brazil and includes amazonian and indigenous spiritual traditions . about 140 members of the church live in the united states and use the tea in a sacred communion . in may 1999 , u.s. customs agents entered the church headquarters in santa fe , new mexico , and seized all of its hoasca . the church became alarmed and cited how the federal government allows an exception for american indians to use another illegal drug , peyote , in their religious ceremonies . in fact , the federal rfra was designed partly to protect the native americans ' use of peyote , said cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` they were a legitimate religion , and this was a legitimate ritual of the religion , and congress wanted to make sure it was protected , '' toobin said of peyote and the 1993 law . the uniao do vegetal , which means `` the union of the plants , '' cited that federal law in suing the federal government . `` the government has never explained why it has accommodated the native american church 's use of peyote -lrb- which contains mescaline , also a controlled substance -rrb- but can not accommodate the udv 's use of hoasca , '' the church said in a statement . the u.s. supreme court ruled in the church 's favor , saying the federal government failed to show a compelling interest to ban the substance for religious use . `` the peyote exception also fatally undermines the government 's broader contention that the controlled substances act establishes a closed regulatory system that admits of no exceptions under rfra , '' the court ruling said . bruce rich , an orthodox jewish prisoner in florida , wanted kosher meals , but the warden said no . so rich sued the state prison system in 2010 , saying its denial of a kosher menu violated the religious land use and institutionalized persons act of 2000 , a landmark civil law rights law for inmates whose predecessor was the federal religious freedom law . rich , 66 , is serving a life sentence for murdering his parents , in their 70s , in 1995 allegedly to inherit their home . the prison system argued the meals were costly and would lead to security concerns , namely `` retaliation against the kosher inmates '' if other inmates believed the higher costs of kosher meals impacted the quality of their food , court papers said . at least 35 other states and the federal government , however , provided kosher diets to inmates . after losing before a magistrate , rich won an appeal before the 11th circuit court , which cited `` the defendant 's meager efforts to explain why florida 's prisons are so different from the penal institutions that now provide kosher meals such that the plans adopted by those other institutions would not work in florida . '' recently baptized in the sikh faith , kawal tagore went to her job with the irs in houston in 2005 carrying a new religious item : a 9-inch kirpan , a small ceremonial sword that resembles a knife but has an edge that is blunted or curved . tagore needed to carry the kirpan at all times as a mandatory article of faith . but the federal government banned her from the building , citing the kirpan as a `` dangerous weapon '' with a more than 3-inch blade , and she was later fired from her accounting job because she refused to keep the kirpan out of the workplace . tagore sued the government under the federal law . tagore cited how the government allowed the public to enter the federal building with more threatening objects : real 2.5-inch blade knives and metal canes , said her attorneys with the newar law firm and the becket fund . also , federal employees inside the building were allowed to use box cutters and cake knives . in november , the federal government agreed to settle the case shortly after the start of tagore 's trial . the settlement included no admission of wrongdoing , the christian science monitor reported . tagore 's attorneys described the settlement as `` a groundbreaking policy allowing sikhs and other religious minorities to wear religious symbols and attire in federal buildings , '' they said in a statement . invoking a religious freedom law and related statutes does n't always equate to victory . in chicago , an association of 40 churches called the civil liberties for urban believers found it too onerous to erect houses of worship in business and commercial zones . the ministers needed a special use permit , but such permits were often thwarted by aldermen or it was too bureaucratic and costly to obtain one , the church leaders claimed . in fact , it was easier to get a club , lodge or community center approved . so the pastors sued the city of chicago in 2000 , alleging that its zoning laws violated the illinois religious freedom statute , the federal religious land use and institutionalized persons act and the u.s. constitution . but in 2003 , the 7th circuit court of appeals upheld a lower court decision and rejected the church group 's claims , finding no substantial burden on the churches , which also failed to establish their rluipa claim . defeated , church leaders were angry . `` the forty -lrb- 40 -rrb- churches in c.l.u.b. and certainly people of all faiths throughout chicago are outraged by the majority opinion which neuters the religious land use and institutionalized persons act passed unanimously by congress in 2000 , '' apostle theodore wilkinson , the group 's chairman , said in a statement . `` also alarming is the court 's conclusion that chicago 's religious assemblies have no free speech protection from zoning laws . the majority opinion would apparently extend free speech protection to religious assemblies only if they allowed live nude dancing , '' he said . at the same time , the city of chicago revised its zoning ordinance to avoid `` the threat of heightened scrutiny under rluipa , '' according to a league of california cities report in 2002 . cnn 's alexandra meeks contributed to this report .\\xc9\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xec&-lrb- cnn -rrb- the terrorist group al-shabaab has claimed an attack on garissa university college in eastern kenya , in which many people have been killed and still more taken hostage . the attack is another step in the ongoing escalation of the terrorist group 's activities , and a clear indicator that the security situation in east africa is deteriorating fast . somalia-based al-shabaab has been behind a string of recent attacks in kenya , the most well-known of them being the massacre at the westgate shopping centre in nairobi in 2013 . cross-border raids into kenya by the group , however , date back to 2011 . al-shabaab incursions triggered a military response by the government in nairobi , which sent troops to somalia as part of an african union mission in support of somalia 's internationally recognized government that had been under pressure from al-shabaab and other militants for several years . al-shabaab is predominantly driven by the same radical interpretation of the koran as al-qaeda and isis -lrb- also known as islamic state -rrb- , but also employs more opportunistic approaches to shoring up local support . its origins lie in al-ittihad al-islami -lrb- unity of islam -rrb- , one of several militant factions that emerged in the wake of the fall of siad barre in 1991 . these disparate groups fought each other and a u.n. peacekeeping mission in the somali civil war that led to the complete collapse of the country , from which it has yet to recover almost quarter of a century later . al-shabaab -lrb- literally `` the youth '' -rrb- split from unity of islam in 2003 and merged with another radical islamist group , the so-called islamic courts union . as their alliance obtained control of somalia 's capital mogadishu in 2006 , ethiopia , the only majority christian country in the region , took military action against the group . the offensive weakened al-shabaab and pushed it back into the rural areas of central and southern somalia , but it failed to defeat it . to the contrary , ethiopia 's invasion and occupation of parts of somalia -- although invited by the somali government and backed by the african union -- enabled al-shabaab to partially re-invent itself as both an islamist and nationalist force opposing a foreign `` christian '' invasion . initially , the group primarily attacked ethiopian forces , but soon began to `` expand '' its activities against the somali government as well . the first attack outside somalia was an attack in the ugandan capital of kampala in 2010 . soon after this , cross-border raids in kenya began , predominantly targeting christians there . increasing its links with al-qaeda , al-shabaab declared its full allegiance in 2012 -- and it is not clear whether it will switch allegiances to isis . much will depend on how the relationships between al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- , a long-time ally of al-shabaab based in yemen , and isis develop . the key point is that al-shabaab 's attack in garissa is part of a broader regional context of instability fueled by a huge number of factors . it must not be interpreted simply as another act of garden-variety fundamentalist terrorism . clearly , the presence and activities of terrorist groups in the region is a major concern , and it is undoubtedly driven by radical and exclusivist interpretations of islam . but the entire region also suffers from a range of other problems : from economic development challenges to environmental degradation ; from organized crime to inter-tribal and inter-communal violence ; from corruption to serious deficits in human rights and good governance . these entrenched inequalities help al-shabaab appeal to a wide variety of potential recruits , who may sympathize with and actively support the group for any number of reasons . attacking a university in northern kenya and separating christian from muslim students epitomizes the way al-shabaab advances itself by exploiting religious , tribal and nationalist identities . ultimately , though , this all comes down to a struggle for control -- over people , over territory , and over resources . as long as the majority of people in the region remain excluded from any meaningful political , economic , and social participation in their societies -- which are dominated by primarily self-interested elites that put their own advance before that of their communities -- human lives matter little in the pursuit of selfish interests . it is important to counter al-shabaab directly , including by military means . but there wo n't be any lasting solution to the wider region 's security problems without a more comprehensive and concerted effort to address the deeper problems of exclusion suffered by the citizens of the countries challenged by al-shabaab . as garissa shows , these problems are still providing oxygen for nihilistic ideologies and their deadly fruit . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .\\x0e\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe3\\x1b-lrb- cnn -rrb- a connecticut teen who has been forced to have chemotherapy to treat hodgkin lymphoma will remain in temporary custody of the state for the time being , according to her attorney , josh michtom . a connecticut juvenile court judge issued a written decision wednesday denying a motion to let the teen , identified in court documents as `` cassandra c. , '' go home . the judge also denied a motion for visitation . the 17-year-old is in remission after nearly six months of forced chemo treatments . on march 16 , michtom tried to convince the court that she should be able to return to her mother 's home because she was no longer at imminent risk of harm from her illness . michtom and attorney michael taylor , who represents cassandra 's mother , jackie fortin , released a written statement after receiving the judge 's decision wednesday : `` we are disappointed in this ruling , not least of all because it draws a factual conclusion that is directly contradicted by the weight of the evidence . we 're conferring with our clients now about next steps , including whether to take another appeal . '' cassandra was diagnosed with hodgkin lymphoma in september and medical experts gave her an 85 % chance of survival if treated with chemotherapy . without it , doctors said at the time , she was likely to die within two years . she started chemotherapy in november but ran away after two days , according to court documents , when she decided she did not want to put the poison of the treatment into her body . in december , a judge ordered the young woman to be under the custody of the connecticut department of children and families . at that time , she was admitted to connecticut children 's medical center in hartford and has remained there since then . doctors surgically implanted a port in cassandra 's chest to administer chemotherapy medications , which began in spite of legal maneuvers to halt them . cassandra is feeling well and is in good shape as far as her health is concerned , according to michtom . `` she 's seen in her case the side effects were n't bad , and she 's been well-treated by the nurses and doctors and does want to complete the treatment , '' he said . her treatment is scheduled to wrap up this month . michtom and taylor failed in their effort before the connecticut supreme court to make the case that cassandra was mature enough to make her own medical decisions . joette katz , the commissioner of the department of children and families , told cnn in march the agency is `` very pleased with cassandra 's progress toward a complete recovery . we understand how difficult this has been for cassandra and her family , but we have had full confidence throughout that the medical professionals involved in her treatment would be successful in saving her life . '' the agency has denied cnn 's request to speak with cassandra or her physicians . according to michtom , the department of children and families could have withdrawn its position for an order of custody but has n't . he said the department sees cassandra as a flight risk because she has run away before . representatives for the department have said in court and in conversations with michtom and taylor that they will withdraw their pending neglect petition once cassandra completes her last round of chemo -- expected around the end of april -- and that she 'll be allowed to return home . so for now , cassandra is said to spend her days reading , watching tv and drawing . `` the hospital is effectively jail , '' michtom said .'!\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

' be the hot 100 's no. 1 song of 2015 ? with `` funk '' now just three weeks from potentially tying `` one sweet day '' for the record , and four weeks from possibly claiming it all to itself , can it rewrite hot 100 history ? it 's too early to forecast charts a month away , but `` funk '' still sports strong leads in all main hot 100 metrics . `` funk '' logs a 13th week atop the digital songs chart with 165,000 downloads sold -lrb- down 12 percent -rrb- in the week ending march 29 , according to nielsen music . that 's a record-tying feat : `` funk ! '' matches flo rida 's 2007-08 hit `` low , '' featuring t-pain , for the most weeks a title has spent at no. 1 on digital songs . `` funk '' also leads streaming songs -lrb- 16.2 million u.s. streams , down 15 percent -rrb- for an 11th week . on radio songs , `` funk '' reigns for a 10th week with 166 million in all-format audience -lrb- down 4 percent -rrb- . it 's the first song to reach double-digit weeks at no. 1 on radio songs since `` blurred lines '' led for 11 . ask billboard : will ` uptown funk !

could another song in the top 10 topple it ? or , is it a song just building , or not even yet released , that will take over ? again , it 's too soon to tell . we know only that a song will eventually dethrone the uncommonly overarching smash that `` funk '' has become . -lrb- at least we think one will ... -rrb- . chart highlights : taylor swift 's ` style ' hits no. 1 on adult pop songs . meanwhile , `` sugar '' takes over at no. 1 on the subscription services-based on-demand songs chart , despite a 10 percent drop to 4.1 million streams . -lrb- `` funk '' falls to no. 3 on the list after 11 weeks at no. 1 . -rrb- `` sugar '' holds at no. 2 on digital songs -lrb- 143,000 , down 8 percent -rrb- ; rises 4-2 on radio songs -lrb- 133 million , up 3 percent -rrb- ; and keeps at no. 4 on streaming songs -lrb- 9.5 million , down 4 percent -rrb- . below sheeran , ellie goulding 's `` love me like you do '' holds at no. 4 on the hot 100 after reaching no. 3 . the fifty shades of grey soundtrack single dips 3-4 on digital songs -lrb- 114,000 , down 14 percent -rrb- and stays at no. 5 on radio songs -lrb- 118 million , up 8 percent -rrb- and streaming songs -lrb- 9 million , up 9 percent -rrb- . from the same hit movie , the weeknd 's `` earned it -lrb- fifty shades of grey -rrb- '' reaches the hot 100 's top five -lrb- 6-5 -rrb- , adding top airplay gainer honors for a second week . on radio songs , it pushes 9-6 with a 23 percent gain to 86 million . `` earned '' -lrb- a possible contender for no. 1 on the hot 100 ... -rrb- holds at no. 6 on both streaming songs -lrb- 8.9 million , up 24 percent -rrb- and digital songs -lrb- 107,000 , up 4 percent -rrb- . the sultry track also takes over at no. 1 on billboard 's hot r&b / hip-hop songs chart . chart highlights : taylor swift 's ` style ' hits no. 1 on adult pop songs . fetty wap 's `` trap queen '' rises 8-6 on the hot 100 , while spending a second week at no. 1 on hot rap songs ; taylor swift 's `` style '' ranks at no. 7 on the hot 100 for a third week after reaching no. 6 -lrb- and , as previously reported , reaches no. 1 on the adult pop songs airplay chart -rrb- ; rihanna , kanye west and paul mccartney 's `` fourfiveseconds '' drops 5-8 on the hot 100 after climbing to no. 4 -lrb- and departs the hot r&b / hip-hop songs summit after seven weeks -rrb- ; and flo rida climbs 10-9 with `` g.d.f.r. , '' featuring sage the gemini and lookas . the rapper 's new ep , my house , arrives tuesday -lrb- april 7 -rrb- . one song is new to the hot 100 's top 10 : la rose 's `` somebody , '' featuring jeremih -lrb- 13-10 -rrb- . the dutch singer 's debut hit lifts 10-8 on radio songs -lrb- 73 million , up 9 percent -rrb- ; backtracks 13-14 on digital songs , but with a 7 percent gain to 68,000 ; and zooms 31-19 on streaming songs -lrb- 4.3 million , up 5 percent -rrb- . the track tops the rhythmic songs airplay chart for a second week . -lrb- jeremih scores his fourth hot 100 top 10 , and first in a featured role . -rrb- . la rose is adjacent to her friend , and mentor , flo rida , on the hot 100 . after she had introduced herself to him at a party , they soon began working together , and she started touring with him . they created `` somebody , '' based on whitney houston 's 1987 hot 100 no. 1 `` i wan na dance with somebody -lrb- who loves me -rrb- , '' as la rose is a `` huge fan of '80s music , '' as she told billboard . she 's currently recording her debut ep . just beyond the hot 100 's top 10 , walk the moon 's `` shut up and dance '' pushes 15-12 , and is the new no. 1 on the hot rock songs chart , while jason derulo 's `` want to want me '' bounds 27-17 . and , rihanna roars in at no. 23 with `` b **** better have my money , '' the chart 's highest debut , powered largely by its no. 5 debut on digital songs -lrb- 108,000 sold since its digital retail arrival on march 26 -rrb- . more details on action below the top 10 in the weekly `` hot 100 chart moves '' column to post on friday -lrb- april 3 -rrb- . see the original story at billboard.com . \\xc2\\xa9 2015 billboard . all rights reserved .\\x1b\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xaf3-lrb- cnn -rrb- president barack obama tied himself to the mast of a nuclear deal with iran even before he became the democratic candidate for president . reaching a good , solid agreement with iran is a worthy , desirable goal . but the process has unfolded under the destructive influence of political considerations , weakening america 's hand and strengthening iran . obama 's political standing and his historic legacy in foreign policy are so deeply intertwined with reaching an accord with iran that if the deal ultimately collapses , he may fear that historians will conclude that his legacy in global affairs collapsed with it . there is a reason one gets the feeling that it is the united states and not iran that is the more eager , even desperate , side in these talks , even though iran is the country whose economy was sent into a deep chill by international sanctions ; the country whose only significant export , oil , lost more than half of its value in recent months . the reason is that obama has a huge political stake in these negotiations . the president may insist that the united states will choose no deal over a bad deal , but few people truly believe he has a credible plan b. few believe it , particularly in the middle east and notably among america 's arab friends , who hold the view that iran is running circles around the united states and outplayed obama . as the writer david rothkopf aptly put it , `` iran is having a great obama administration . '' that 's a belief that has already started shaking up the region . saudi arabia has said that it will pursue nuclear weapons if it believes iran has not been stopped , and there is little doubt that other countries among iran 's muslim rivals will do the same . in fact , the notion that obama is not handling the iranian threat effectively is contributing to a new war in yemen , where saudi arabia and other arabs are trying to push back against gains by iran 's allies . we can trace it all back to the democratic primaries in 2007 , when then-sen . obama said he would meet iran 's leaders `` without preconditions , '' leading his rival , hillary clinton , to call the idea `` irresponsible and frankly naive . '' as the years of his presidency unfolded , and the middle east started coming apart , finding a deal with iran started to look like the one major foreign policy achievement obama might leave behind . the political imperative started to intrude in strategic considerations on an issue that is of transcendent importance to world peace . the framework agreement announced on thursday came two days after obama 's march 31 deadline . the u.s.-imposed deadline served only to pressure the united states , and the french ambassador very publicly decried as a `` bad tactic . '' that bad tactic was a political move , a push to produce some sort of result , however vague , to protect the talks from critics . again , a solid agreement that ensures iran will not produce nuclear weapons would be a most welcome development . but the agreement so far does not look promising . it certainly shows the final outcome will differ greatly from what obama had vowed . in a presidential debate in 2012 , obama described a crystal clear goal for negotiations . `` the deal we 'll accept is they end their nuclear program . it 's very straightforward . '' nobody is talking about iran ending its nuclear program . not even close . iran will be allowed to keep one-third of its more than 6,000 centrifuges . that 's not a small symbolic number . and it does not appear as though any of its nuclear facilities will be dismantled , although fordow will contain no nuclear materials . iran has insisted all along that its nuclear program has only civilian uses . the fact is that iran has a well-established record of lying and concealing the elements of its nuclear program to u.n. inspectors . and the u.n. agency chief says that has not stopped . a couple of weeks ago , with days left until the negotiating deadline , u.n. nuclear chief yukiya amano said iran is still stonewalling . `` we are still not in a position to conclude that all nuclear material in iran is -lsb- for a -rsb- peaceful purpose , '' he warned . the negotiations ' starting point is that iran would like to have the bomb and the international community wants to delay that as much as possible -- and preferably , forever . the world only learned about iran 's secret facilities at arak and natanz after dissidents raised the alarm . iran , we have learned repeatedly , is very good at lying to international inspectors . it is well-established that it has had something to hide about its nuclear program . it is well-established that many of iran 's neighbors do n't trust it and are anxious about the u.s.-led international dealings with iran . it is well-established that iran has engaged in international terrorism and in destabilizing the region . it is also clear that it took harsh international sanctions and a collapse in oil prices to bring iran to the negotiating table . it was iran that had the most to lose from a failure of talks . but political considerations turned the united states into the supplicant . the framework agreement starts lifting those indispensable sanctions much too soon . nuclear enrichment will continue , although at a lower level . iran officially , legally , becomes a nuclear threshold state , with the capability to make the final dash to a bomb within a `` breakout '' period of one year , the time when presumably inspectors would discover violation and allow the rest of the world to act . even the fordow facility , conveniently inside a fortified bunker in a mountain , will remain in existence , though `` converted '' to a nuclear `` research facility '' and without nuclear material on site . international sanctions lifting will begin almost immediately . its nuclear infrastructure will remain largely in place , even if operating at a reduced pace , giving iran much of what it wanted . with iranian forces gaining ground in arab lands and iranian commanders declaring the destruction of israel `` nonnegotiable '' and threatening saudi arabia , this deal does not look reassuring . obama is right that a diplomatic solution is the most desirable option . but the deal so far looks like -lrb- another -rrb- win for iran . it introduces enough restrictions that it could give the president the political cover he wants , but it does not do enough to make the world safe from nuclear proliferation and more potentially catastrophic instability in the middle east .=\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' this has been the first product recall in the 108-year history of blue bell creameries , the company said . listeriosis is a serious infection caused by eating food contaminated with listeria , and primarily affects the elderly , pregnant women , newborns and people with weakened immune systems , according to the cdc . symptoms of a listeria infection are fever and muscle aches , sometimes associated with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms . in the united states , an estimated 1,600 people become seriously ill each year , and approximately 16 % of these illnesses result in death . cervical infections caused by listeriosis in pregnant women may result in stillbirth or spontaneous abortion during the second or third trimesters . cnn 's debra goldschmidt , amanda watts and jacque wilson contributed to this report .\\xfa\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the individual members of the fraternity will likely be considered private individuals , and not public figures ; the latter have a harder time proving defamation . a private person suing for defamation must establish that the defendant has published a false factual statement that is about the person and that it also harms the person 's reputation . the private plaintiff also must show that the defendant knew that the statement was false , or believed it was true but lacked a reasonable basis , or acted negligently in checking the facts . at first blush , that sounds like it fits perfectly , right ? the columbia report may go a long way toward establishing at least a modicum of the required intent . but that 's only half the battle . there are strict rules about who can be a plaintiff in a defamation action like this . the identity of the aspiring plaintiff matters . first , let 's eliminate uva . the university is a public university , and therefore it is a governmental entity . the supreme court has been clear on the issue of libelous statements about the government : the government can not sue for defamation . there is no such cause of action in american jurisprudence . now the fraternities , starting with phi kappa psi . a fraternity is not an individual , but a group . a plaintiff in a defamation case must show that the statements were `` of or concerning '' the plaintiff . it sounds obvious , but if you 're going to say a statement hurt you , you have to prove the statement actually was about you to begin with . when the statements are about a group without naming an individual , it 's hard to say the statement is `` concerning '' the individual -- and groups generally can not sue . for example , you can be sued if you call a specific lawyer a thief , but that same person can not sue you if you simply call all lawyers thieves . defamatory statements about a group are therefore not actionable by the group 's individual members , for the most part . like all rules , however , there are exceptions . if the defamatory language is about `` a comparatively small group of persons and the defamatory part is easily imputed against all members of the small group , an individual member may sue . '' if i said , `` the 1980 philadelphia phillies infielders were a bunch of criminals '' -lrb- they were n't -rrb- , the individual players could sue , because that mean statement is clearly about certain persons -- if i said that -- which i did n't . phi kappa psi would likely argue that the `` small group '' exception fits it perfectly : even if the individual members were not identified by name , the defamatory story has been imputed directly to individual members , who have suffered by their association with the group . on the other hand , rolling stone 's lawyers would likely argue that the group is so large and fluid -lrb- after all , the membership changes somewhat every year -rrb- , that even though the fraternity 's reputation is tarnished , the members have suffered no individualized injury . as for the other fraternities on campus but not implicated in the story , that 's likely a group that moves from the small category to large , and the members of greek life generally will have a harder time bringing a lawsuit . lawyers will tell you that a libel suit is one of those things that citizens often threaten each other with on facebook , but that such cases are rarely actually filed . that 's because a plaintiff usually has to show some kind of financial harm . so if your aunt edna calls you a loser on twitter , you 're going to have to spend money on an expert to explain to a jury how that actually damaged you financially . and since most of the people who waste time threatening each other with defamation suits on facebook live in their moms ' basements and are `` between jobs , '' these are not the kind of people who have money or reputation to damage in the first place . the uva situation is not your run-of-the-mill defamation case . the university wo n't be able to sue , but if the members of the fraternity can get past some of the preliminary hurdles of a defamation claim , and they can make a tangible case for damages , then this could be one of those rare successful defamation cases .\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfc#-lrb- cnn -rrb- the fbi has confirmed that one of its most wanted terrorists , the malaysian bomb maker known as marwan , was killed in an otherwise disastrous raid in the philippines in january . marwan , whose real name is zulkifli bin hir , was believed by the fbi to a member of southeast asian terror group jemaah islamiyah 's central command . the fbi said in february that a dna sample -- understood to be from a severed finger -- taken from a man killed in a raid in the southern philippines showed a link with a known relative of marwan . but the fbi now says tests have confirmed that the dead man was the wanted islamic extremist . `` after a thorough review of forensic data and information obtained from our philippine law enforcement partners , the fbi has assessed that terrorism subject , zulkifli abdhir ... is deceased and has been removed from the fbi 's list of most wanted terrorists , '' david bowdich , assistant director in charge of the fbi 's los angeles field office , told cnn in a statement . the fbi had been offering a $ 5 million reward for information leading to marwan 's capture in the wake of his 2007 indictment on terror charges in a california court . it accused him of being a supplier of ieds to terrorist organizations , and having conducted bomb making training for terror groups , including the philippines-based abu sayyaf . marwan had previously been falsely reported dead after a raid by philippine security forces in 2012 . the philippines has been fighting an insurgency in the predominantly muslim south for years , and last year signed a peace agreement with the moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- , the largest rebel group in the region . but in january it launched a surprise raid in pursuit of marwan at mamapasono , in the southern province of maguindanao . the mission went disastrously awry . forty-four members of the police 's elite special action force -lrb- saf -rrb- unit were killed in the assault , targeting an area controlled by the bangsamoro islamic freedom fighters -lrb- biff -rrb- -- a hardline splinter group which has rejected the peace deal with the philippines government . according to a report released by the institute for policy analysis of conflict -lrb- ipac -rrb- last month , the biff faction sheltering marwan had sworn allegiance to isis . in the immediate aftermath of the assault , the saf company charged with executing marwan came under fire , before another saf company stationed in nearby milf territory as a `` blocking force '' became engaged in an eight-hour firefight with milf fighters . according to the ipac report , the saf `` blocking '' company eventually ran out of ammunition and only one of their number survived , . eighteen milf fighters were killed and a number of biff fighters may also died . the clash shattered a three-year ceasefire with the milf , authorities said . a national day of mourning was declared as the men were laid to rest . bowdich expressed the fbi 's `` sincere condolences to the brave officers of the special action force who lost their lives while attempting to apprehend this dangerous fugitive . '' while an saf superintendent said at a eulogy for the fallen commandos that their sacrifice had been worth it , controversy has dogged the botched mission in the philippines . the ipac report argued that the `` single-minded focus '' of authorities on killing marwan has threatened the peace agreement with the milf , which is yet to cross the final hurdle of being passed into law by the philippines congress . `` the best chance the southern philippines has ever had for peace may now be in jeopardy , '' read the report , which argued that the mamapasano fiasco was the result of a misguided emphasis on killing marwan . the report argued that , although marwan had aided terror attacks and provided funds and equipment to milf and abu sayyaf , he was not `` the master bomber that his reputation suggested . '' yet for the philippines authorities and their u.s. allies , killing marwan had become such a priority that security forces bypassed the mechanisms that had been established to alert the milf to such operations , for fear of word leaking to their target . the report quoted an anonymous indonesian associate of marwan 's who described the malaysian as `` a little snake who has been blown up into a dragon .

'' when president obama stood with john lewis and other veterans of the civil rights movement in front of the edmund pettus bridge last month to mark the 50th anniversary of bloody sunday , he inspired us all by saying : `` with effort , we can roll back poverty and the roadblocks to opportunity . ... with effort , we can protect the foundation stone of our democracy for which so many marched across this bridge -- and that is the right to vote . '' america is better -- and we solve more problems -- with more democracy , not less . unfortunately rand paul has demonstrated that he disagree with that basic principle . paul tried once again from that stage in louisville to fashion himself as the one member of his party courageous enough to try to broaden republican appeal to constituencies they ignore year after year . but his record makes it very clear that his views are outdated , outside of the mainstream , and disqualifying for a man who wants to lead our country . the american people deserve a leader who wo n't disrespect their intelligence , who wo n't pander to them when it 's convenient , and who wo n't work to dismantle the progress we have made over the last five decades . what i heard today , did n't change the facts about rand paul 's record . the american people deserve better than rand paul .\\x95 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb5?-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states department of justice has named a new defendant in the war on drugs , and the charges are serious indeed . a 15-count indictment filed in federal court in california bristles with accusations of conspiracies , transporting prescription pharmaceuticals dispensed with illegal prescriptions , violations of the controlled substances act , misbranding charges , and money laundering charges . who is this menace to society ? fedex . yes , the courier delivery service . wait , can companies even be charged with crimes ? where would a fedex be incarcerated ? is there a corporate shawshank prison ? how does one fit a company for a prison jumpsuit ? it turns out a corporation can indeed be prosecuted like a person . it 's a practice the supreme court has approved of for over a century . in fact , in many ways they are easier to prosecute than people . corporations do n't have all the same inconvenient constitutional rights as citizens accused of crimes . imprisoning convicted citizens is expensive , but corporate convictions , on the other hand , turn tidy profits for the u.s. government , with zero prison overhead . even if corporations can be held criminally liable , should a courier service like fedex be held liable for `` possessing '' what bad guys may send through the service ? the answer , according to fedex , is not just `` no , '' but a `` no '' so conclusive that this case should never see a courtroom . the company maintains that it is innocent . it has a point . `` possession '' is an elusive concept . when it comes to drugs , the law recognizes two kinds of possession : actual and constructive . actual possession is when you have physical control over the contraband . when you have a gun in your hand or drugs in your pocket , you `` actually '' possess those things . the somewhat hazier concept of `` constructive possession '' means you can `` possess '' something without even having it on your person , as long as you have ownership , dominion or control over the contraband or the property where it is found . for example , the government would argue that while you may not have actual possession of the 5,000 oxycontin pills in the trunk of your car parked in your driveway , you `` constructively '' possessed them . conversely , sometimes you can be holding something in your hand or have it in your vehicle , but not `` possess '' it either actually or constructively , in the eyes of the law . such is the case with couriers who routinely drive to your home , walk up to your door and hand you a package , completely ignorant about what is inside it . it 's hard to argue the ups guy intentionally `` possessed '' your subscription to porno mags , in their nondescript brown packaging . that is the idea behind the `` common carrier '' exception to possession , and a large part of fedex 's compelling legal argument . a `` common carrier '' is one who offers its services to members of the public -- without much discretion -- and is engaged in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation . the public policy reasons behind `` common carrier '' exemptions make sense ; the industry simply could n't function if every driver , courier and handler who touches a valid shipment of oxycontin had to obtain a prescription for opiates to be legally allowed to deliver it to your front door . that would lead to an absurd result . that 's why the controlled substances act and the food , drug , and cosmetic act allow common carriers to lawfully possess controlled substances , so long as it is in the usual course of their business . of course , this is not a permission slip for drug runners to avoid liability by calling themselves `` common carriers . '' that 's why the `` usual course of business '' language acts as an additional safety measure . in court papers , fedex 's lawyers offer the example of an airline whose sole activity was flying controlled substances from jamaica to miami . this would not be acting in the usual course of business of a common carrier , since this imaginary airline is not offering its services to the public , generally . on the other hand , fedex argues that it is indeed a common carrier , performing the normal duties of a common carrier , because -lrb- a -rrb- it is engaged in the business of transportation of property and -lrb- b -rrb- it offers its services to the public generally . it 's hard to imagine extending liability to common carriers for possession of contraband . does this mean a greyhound bus driver becomes liable for marijuana possessed by a passenger ? the bus driver would argue he has no reason to know if a particular passenger is carrying drugs . but if the guy boards the bus with a grateful dead t-shirt and a set of bongos , should n't the driver at least have a hunch ? that seems dangerously close to profiling . is this another illogical straw man argument ? maybe . obviously , the department of justice disagrees , which is why it has brought this criminal prosecution . according to the indictment , from at least as early as 2004 , the drug enforcement administration , the food and drug administration , and members of congress put fedex on notice that illegal internet pharmacies were using its shipping services to distribute controlled substances and prescription drugs in violation of the controlled substances act , the food , drug , and cosmetic act , and numerous state laws . the indictment alleges that as early as 2004 , fedex knew that it was delivering drugs to dealers and addicts . fedex 's couriers in kentucky , tennessee , and virginia expressed safety concerns that were circulated to fedex senior management . the doj is making the argument that even though fedex carries and delivers whatever is handed to it by the public , fedex knew or should have known in specific instances that it was involving itself in suspicious drug activity . it raises a larger question , though : why do we prosecute inanimate objects that we ca n't even incarcerate ? the answer is the same reason that the drug dealers deal drugs , and drug smugglers smuggle them : money . power . the government in these cases gets to impose its will and policy upon large corporations -- in this case , it would be to force fedex to help law enforcement in policing shady pharmaceutical transportation . the government also gets to extract gargantuan sums of money from corporations in `` deferred prosecution agreements . '' the reason you do n't see a lot of corporate trials is because most companies prefer to enter into such agreements ; for a company , a public prosecution alone would be tantamount to a death sentence , whether or not it 's found guilty . still , every defense attorney would love to offer the option to his or her human clients of avoiding felony conviction and a potential life sentence -- by agreeing to pay some fines . do n't get me wrong : i 'm all about prosecuting the black market , especially if that means prosecuting the guys who send us those spam emails to our work accounts with `` v1agra '' in the subject line , for our co-workers to see while we go to the bathroom . i want those guys locked up for sure . i 'm just not sure that fedex has anything to do with the kingpins of the `` fr33 cyalis '' email campaign . the doj 's underlying intentions are noble enough -- this is an attack on the supply line of the illegal drug market by attacking the actual supply chain . it makes good strategic sense . it might seem like good financial sense in the short run , with the millions in fines extracted from corporations , but that money has to come from somewhere . it 's just a matter of time before that trickles down to job cuts and less leg room on our flights . it probably does n't make good legal sense either . yes , we have been treating corporations as fictional `` persons '' for centuries in some ways -- but it 's silly to treat them as persons in all ways . fedex has a strong argument for dismissal in this case , but even if not , it wo n't be swapping its logo orange for prison orange anytime soon .\\x8b\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xea*-lrb- cnn -rrb- this is the end . beautiful friend , the end . for the 1960s , the end arrived with -- depending on your ideals and your tribe -- either the rolling stones ' altamont fiasco in december 1969 , the kent state shootings in may 1970 or richard nixon 's 1972 re-election . for `` mad men , '' the `` end of an era , '' as its slogan has it , begins sunday . over the past eight years , the show about a 1960s advertising agency and its collision with changing times has become part of the national fabric , if never a huge ratings hit . stores have created fashion lines inspired by the show ; there have been `` mad men '' cocktails and `` mad men '' museum exhibits and even `` mad men '' presidential references . don draper , the creative director played by jon hamm , has become a symbol of the times -- his and , sometimes , ours . its subjects have taken the show to heart . in march , a `` mad men '' bench was unveiled in front of new york 's time & life building , where the fictional firm of sterling cooper & partners has its headquarters . the end of a tv series brings with it some risk . `` the sopranos , '' `` mad men '' creator matthew weiner 's former employer , divided fans with its famous cut-to-black finale . on the other hand , `` mad men 's '' former amc stablemate , `` breaking bad , '' was saluted for an almost perfect landing . speaking of landings : the last season -- technically , the first half of season 7 -- ended with the moon landing in july 1969 . though weiner and his cast have been typically tight-lipped -- weiner even hid the finale from his cast at first -- it 's reasonable to assume the new season will pick up soon afterward . what 's going to happen ? here are some educated guesses . with the '60s screaming towards their conclusion , `` mad men '' probably wo n't jump ahead much . the latter half of 1969 included the manson murders , the woodstock festival , a new york mayoral campaign and the vietnam war moratorium demonstrations -- plenty of fodder for the characters to interact with , if only tangentially . who knows ? the show might even mention the miracle mets . it would be a nice way to acknowledge the agency 's late lane pryce . of course , weiner might have a different idea ; he 's from baltimore . `` mad men '' is generally a show about disintegration , reflective of the '60s themselves . the old orders are falling apart : white-shoe wasp firms like sterling cooper giving way to the ethnic pace-setters such as doyle dane bernbach ; grimy new york replaced by sunny los angeles ; the `` good war '' generation butting heads with the `` make love , not war '' cohort ; vacuum tubes and ledger books being displaced by a sleek , solid-state ibm world . it 's all an ad agency can do to keep up . last season saw plenty of intraoffice turmoil , thanks to the ill-fitting merger between sterling cooper and former rival cutler gleason and chaough . though the agency survived , it 's now without bert cooper -lrb- robert morse -rrb- and under the ownership of -lrb- real-life -rrb- madison avenue titan mccann erickson . that 's not a recipe for long-term survival , and expect a number of longtime characters -- ken cosgrove -lrb- aaron staton -rrb- , harry crane -lrb- rich sommer -rrb- and perhaps even joan harris -lrb- christina hendricks -rrb- -- to look for an exit . roger sterling -- the wisecracking executive played by john slattery -- might find an exit as well , but not one he 's anticipating . he 's suffered two heart attacks . he drinks to excess . he 's never grown up . bet on a sudden and shocking departure . on the other hand , peggy olson 's star has continued to rise -lrb- much like one of the character 's models , advertising wunderkind mary wells lawrence -rrb- . she left sterling cooper once ; indeed , she would n't have returned if her new agency had n't merged with her old one . if olson , played by elisabeth moss , bolts the firm , it will probably be to head her own agency -- and possibly get married . that is , if she 's still interested in such an old-fashioned tradition . in recent seasons , don 's ex-wife , betty -lrb- january jones -rrb- , has lost herself amid all the turmoil . she sees herself through the eyes of her spouses , and though husband henry francis -lrb- christopher stanley -rrb- has been far more supportive than don , he 's a busy man . and sally , don 's daughter -lrb- kiernan shipka -rrb- , is proving to be a handful . on the one hand , she 's obviously bright ; on the other , she 's a teenager and starting to rebel . in recent seasons she 's run away and started sneaking cigarettes , and she 's always fighting with her mother . you could see her hitchhiking to woodstock , or at least dropping out of school . anything 's possible , but given all that the character has been through -- divorces , affairs , office politics , morose late-night rides with glen bishop -- it 's a bit on the nose , is n't it ? instead , try this : it 's april 1 , 1970 . richard nixon is signing legislation banning cigarette ads on radio and television , reminding don of the day 10 years earlier when he came up with the lucky strike campaign that began the series . no fool , he had seen this day coming years before . he 'll fix himself a drink , ponder buying an avocado-colored refrigerator , clean out his ashtray and leave the show the way he arrived : on top of the zeitgeist , unable to accept his past and utterly , inscrutably alone .y\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' now , he 's stirring things up again with a series of tweets documenting three traffic stops in seven weeks . `` stopped by the cops again wish me luck , '' he posted early tuesday , along with a photo showing him behind the wheel of a car with what looks like blue police lights in the background . he posted similar photos in february . many african-americans have long bemoaned the phenomenon of being pulled over for no apparent reason , calling it `` driving while black .

'' twitter user yeshacallahan posted . appearing on cnn , washington defended the tweet , saying he wanted to `` excite a conversation . '' years ago , rock filmed a sketch for his `` chris rock '' show on hbo in which he detailed ways to avoid being beaten by police as a black man . besides obeying the law , he suggested bringing a white friend along for the ride . he did just that last year in a segment of `` comedians in cars getting coffee '' with jerry seinfeld . the two chat as seinfeld drives an orange lamborghini . and what happened ? they get pulled over after seinfeld goes a bit heavy on the gas . `` here 's the crazy thing , '' rock tells seinfeld as the police officer stops the duo . `` if you were n't here , i 'd be scared .

      "b\"\\xf0\\x1cabu dhabi , united arab emirates -lrb- cnn -rrb- lost luggage after a long flight is a common , frustrating occurrence of modern air travel . and sometimes , airlines lose things that are irreplaceable . american jennifer stewart says she was devastated to learn that etihad airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from abu dhabi to new york city : her 2-year-old pet cat , felix . stewart said that she and her husband , joseph naaman , booked felix on their etihad airways flight from the united arab emirates to new york 's john f. kennedy international airport on april 1 . shortly after the plane arrived in new york that evening , felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of kennedy airport , according to etihad airways . felix was able to get loose , stewart said she believes , because the cat 's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area . stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at kennedy last week and notified them that their cat 's carrier had been crushed . photographs taken by stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat 's carrier . at least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed . nearly one week later , felix remains missing . `` for them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo , not a live animal , makes me sick , '' stewart said . `` you trust that people care and are doing the job well , and then this happens . '' a representative for etihad airways told cnn that that the loss of pets during air travel is `` extremely rare . '' the airline shipped more than 200 pets last year . etihad airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the new york airport to help locate the missing cat . the abu dhabi-based carrier also said it hired `` third-party specialists '' to help in the hunt for felix . `` we deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search , '' etihad airways told cnn in a statement . `` we will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident , as the safety and care of pets traveling with etihad airways is a top priority . '' stewart and her husband booked the cat 's flight as part of their job relocation to the united states after living in abu dhabi for more than three years . the couple said they spent $ 1,200 to ship felix on the 14-hour flight . `` you pay all of this money , but for what ? people assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of , but they 're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage , '' stewart said . it is n't the first time a pet has gone missing at new york 's busiest airport . in august 2011 , a cat escaped from its carrier before an american airlines flight from new york to san francisco . that cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport . but the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost . this weekend , stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit , which provided a highly trained detection dog , to help track down felix 's scent . a wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate felix 's safe return , according to the port authority of new york and new jersey . officials at kennedy have offered to assist etihad airways as the airline investigates what happened , the port authority said . stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers . `` we just want to find felix . but i just do n't know if we will , '' she said .4\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd8.-lrb- cnn -rrb- easter is unique on the christian calendar , a major point in the cycle of the religious year , and one that has always been able to resist the commercialization and culture warring that surrounds christmas . that 's in part because easter is genuinely about how religious impulses , and patterns , can operate in ways that affect our lives . nevertheless , i 'm often surprised by how little people , even those supposedly within the christian tradition , actually know about what is called holy week and its culmination on easter sunday . at a time when our culture is roiled by questions of identity and ethics -lrb- and tolerance -rrb- that have profound religious implications , it 's worth pausing to explore this crucial holiday -- and the awareness of the human condition , in all its sadness and glory , that it engenders . after all , holy week calls mostly to those who incline their minds and hearts in its direction with seriousness of intent . still , the fuss must puzzle those looking on , wondering what it all means . why do christians make so much of this springtime week , and make so much of easter weekend ? there is a phrase that many never come across , even among christians : easter triduum . this refers to the three days of easter that begin with good friday , proceed through holy saturday , and conclude with easter sunday . it 's definitely a progression , although the word itself -- triduum -- can refer to any three days of prayer . easter triduum has a kind of major prologue in maundy thursday , the day when , by tradition , jesus celebrated the last supper with his disciples in the upper room in jerusalem on the night before he was crucified . the idea of holy communion begins with this meal , which was a passover meal . jesus , of course , was jewish , as were all his disciples . he was never trying to erase judaism and found a new religion . his work involved modifying and extending judaism in fresh ways . on maundy thursday , christians sometimes practice the washing of feet , recalling that jesus washed the very dusty feet of his disciples at the last supper as a way of demonstrating profound humility -- showing that he was himself a servant -- and modeling a kind of ideal behavior . good friday is n't , in fact , so good . it 's the day of the crucifixion , when jesus was scourged and beaten , forced to carry his cross to golgotha , the `` place of the skull , '' and nailed to the cross itself for what must have been an agonizing death . the actual scene of the crucifixion varies from gospel to gospel , as do his last words , assembled into the so-called `` seven last words '' of jesus by adding up fragments from different gospels . some of these words are quotations , as when jesus asked god why he has abandoned him : this is a quote from the 22nd psalm , which opens : `` my god , my god , why hast thou forsaken me ? '' good friday is a day of death , sacrifice , displacement , fear . holy saturday is probably the least understood day of the easter triduum . it 's a passageway between the darkness of the crucifixion and the bright hope of easter . this day occupies an anxious space in human experience , when the certain knowledge of something dreadful is n't quite erased -- ca n't be erased -- simply by hope . it 's a day of depression , a day of suspension . then comes easter , with the aura of the resurrection . i 'm always moved by the deep symbolism of this mythic moment , when the body of christ becomes what is called a `` glorified body . '' this was not , as i 've said elsewhere , the great resuscitation , although that 's part of it , too . resurrection implies a total transformation , something beyond the physical realm . it 's very important that almost nobody who encounters jesus after the resurrection can really recognize him , know him , or understand him as the same person who was with them before he was crucified . easter embraces the great mystery of resurrection , with its promise of transformation -- a shift from one form to another , and a change that moves well beyond any literal understanding . the three days of easter , the triduum , occur only once a year on the calendar . but the really interesting thing is that we all experience the pattern of the three days again and again . we find ourselves emptied out in small ways , nailed to our own trees in life , embarrassed or broken by life . it was the buddha who famously observed that life is suffering . good friday embodies the christian version of that truth . jesus suffered in the way all of us must suffer . we must all die , perhaps less ignominiously but just as certainly . our friends and families must die . we all experience illness , loss , sadness , a loss of confidence , darkness . this is simply part of the human experience . we dive again and again into holy saturday , too -- a period of transition , when the bleakness of suffering is perhaps slightly behind us but nothing restorative seems in view . we know well this in-between time ; it 's an anxious passage , with only a glimmer on the horizon of potential hope . and we 've all been resurrected , again and again , perhaps in tiny ways . this is the joy of easter , and it 's not something reserved for one day on the calendar . it 's there whenever we experience what t.s. eliot once called the `` timeless moment , '' which can only occur -- paradoxically -- in time itself . it 's a mystical point where timelessness intersects with time . i suspect we all experience the triduum frequently , sometimes more than once in a single day . but the ritual enactment of these three days of the easter season reminds all of those who practice christianity -- and perhaps those who do n't -- that we should expect to move through darkness into light . it 's a pattern that describes a kind of spiritual progression . it 's good cause for celebration , too : and one that wo n't easily be co-opted by secular culture .g\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe90-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` sell all that you own and distribute the money to the poor , and you will have treasure in heaven ; then come , follow me , '' jesus tells the rich man in one of his best-known parables . it was a mantra he invoked repeatedly : the poor were blessed , and it was easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it was for the well-to-do to enter paradise . meanwhile , jesus told his twelve apostles to leave their day jobs and follow him on an itinerant mission with few prospects of success and no visible means of support . so how did this wandering band of first-century evangelists support themselves ? clearly , money was a concern , and not just as an impediment to salvation . in the new testament , money gets 37 mentions , while `` gold '' gets 38 citations , `` silver '' merits 20 , and `` copper '' four . `` coin '' comes up eight times , and `` purse '' and `` denarii '' -- the roman currency -- get half a dozen mentions each for a total of 119 currency referrals . perhaps the most relevant reference is also one of the most charged passages in the new testament : . as the gospel of john tells it , six days before passover , jesus was in bethany at the house of his friend lazarus , whom he had raised from the dead . a woman named mary takes a jar of costly perfumed oil and anoints the feet of the reclining jesus . she dries his feet with her hair , an irresistible image for artists and dramatists . judas iscariot objected to the act . `` why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and the money given to the poor ? '' judas asks . though 300 denarii was the annual wage of a laborer , jesus told judas to leave her alone , and foreshadowing his fate , said the anointing would be useful for his burial , and besides , `` you always have the poor with you '' -- but jesus would not always be there . what that passage makes clear is that the jesus community had a common purse because they needed money to survive . so how much ? `` i imagine the ministry functioned at a subsistence level , '' rabbi joshua garroway , a professor of early christianity and the second commonwealth at hebrew union college in los angeles . jesus and his disciples walked , wore what they had , slept outside or in stayed in friends ' homes . they ate what they caught or what others shared . `` i venture to guess that begging and hospitality will have sufficed to meet the basic needs of jesus and the companions with whom he traveled , '' garroway said . garroway said that it was possible , even likely , that jesus and his followers received donations from supporters , and possibly substantial ones from some of the rich people who were drawn to his ministry despite -- or perhaps because of -- his preaching on the perils of wealth . the gospel of luke gives us a glimpse of how jesus ' ministry functioned on a practical level : . `` soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages , proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of god . the twelve were with him , as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities : mary , called magdalene , from whom seven demons had gone out , and joanna , the wife of herod 's steward chuza , and susanna , and many others , who provided for them out of their resources . '' so , according to luke , women whom jesus had healed in turn provided for him out of their `` resources , '' with mary magdalene and joanna capturing our attention -- one by virtue of her husband , and the other , by her stature in the story of jesus . joanna was an upper-class woman married to a man who was intelligent and capable enough to manage the complicated household of herod antipas , the son of herod the great , the violent and ambitious head of judea . as part of this volatile but powerful household , joanna would be uniquely positioned to help jesus with her resources , being both wealthy and having palace connections . she attends to him during his life , and , the gospels tell us , after his death , as one of the trio of women who go to his tomb and find it empty . with her on that morning is mary magdalene , also identified as -- among other things -- a financial supporter of jesus . mary likely came from the prosperous town of magdala , on the sea of galilee . as home to a thriving fishing industry , as well as dye and textile works , mary could well have come from an affluent family -- or have been a successful business woman herself . mary magdalene was free to travel the country with jesus and his disciples , so was unlikely to have a husband and children waiting for her at home , and in `` finding jesus '' we examine the gnostic gospel of mary magdalene and explore the argument that jesus was , in fact , her husband . she may have simply been an independent woman with her own resources who found a compelling message , and messenger . not only was mary magdalene one of jesus ' most devoted followers , who stuck with him all the way from galilee to jerusalem , from the ministry to the cross and the tomb , but also she provided for him from her own means , said mark goodacre , a professor of new testament and christian origins at duke university . when the gospels speak of her `` ministering '' to jesus , they are explaining that she was one of the key figures in jesus ' everyday mission , goodacre continues . along with other women like joanna and susanna , she was one of those who made his mission viable . along with these women , men like joseph of arimathea and nicodemus , both men of stature and wealth , may have chipped in to help fund jesus ' ministry . the gospels reveal that both these men were rich , and supported jesus -- indeed , it was joseph who removed jesus from the cross on good friday , anointing his body with the help of nicodemus , and placing him in the tomb that joseph had reserved for himself . after the resurrection on that first easter sunday , the movement jesus started grew exponentially , and the church 's relationship to money grew more complicated as the needs became greater . michael mckinley is co-author , with david gibson , of `` finding jesus : faith . fact . forgery. : six holy objects that tell the remarkable story of the gospels .

      "b\"\\xdd%-lrb- cnn -rrb- the nation 's top stories will be unfolding tuesday in courthouses and political arenas across the country . massachusetts is hosting two of the highest-profile court trials in recent memory -- those of former new england patriot aaron hernandez and boston bombing suspect dzhokhar tsarnaev . both lengthy trials are coming to a close . in louisville , kentucky , sen. rand paul made the not-so-surprising announcement that he will run for president , while in chicago , voters will head to the polls in a very surprising runoff between mayor rahm emanuel and challenger jesus `` chuy '' garcia . and in ferguson , missouri , the shadow of michael brown and the protests over his shooting by officer darren wilson will loom large over the city 's elections . here 's a breakdown of what to expect today and how we got here : . tsarnaev , who 's accused of detonating a bomb at the 2013 boston marathon along with his now-deceased brother , faces the stiffest of penalties -- life in prison or the death penalty -- if he 's found guilty on any of 17 capital counts against him , including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism . the 13th juror : what defense ? on monday , survivors and victims ' families wept and tsarnaev fidgeted at a defense table as jurors heard a prosecutor allege that the 21-year-old `` brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets . '' the jury on tuesday morning began what is expected to be a lengthy deliberation process on 30 total charges , before the so-called penalty phase , should he be found guilty on any counts . it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd , yet on monday , hernandez 's defense team wrapped up its witnesses in less than a day . closing arguments are scheduled for tuesday , and the jury will begin deliberations soon thereafter . jurors in fall river , massachusetts , will be asked to decide if hernandez is culpable in the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in the summer of 2013 . much of the evidence against hernandez is circumstantial , and among the facts the jury will be asked to take into consideration are new england patriots owner robert kraft 's testimony , the testimony of hernandez 's fiancee , some grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system and a footprint left by a nike air jordan shoe . hernandez known for swagger , even in court . ok , sure , no one was floored when the kentucky senator announced his bid for the oval office , but of course it was news when he made it official tuesday . paul is expected to hit the campaign trail visiting the all-important early voters in new hampshire , south carolina , iowa and nevada . the physician rode a wave of tea party popularity into the senate in 2010 , where he carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism , and he is banking on a coalition of younger voters and traditional republicans to usher him into the white house . paul and sen. ted cruz are the only declared candidates for the gop nomination , though the field will certainly grow and could include the likes of florida 's jeb bush , new jersey 's chris christie , wisconsin 's scott walker , south carolina 's lindsey graham and florida 's marco rubio . would rand be here without ron ? it 's the windy city 's first runoff for a citywide office , and it 's being billed as a battle for the `` future of chicago . '' in one corner , you have emanuel , president barack obama 's notoriously hard-charging former chief of staff , and in the other , you have jesus `` chuy '' garcia , a county commissioner who has come to embody populist and liberal democrats ' frustrations with the chicago incumbent . after emanuel failed to snare half the vote in february 's general election , he will go head-to-head with garcia . the timing is interesting , too , as easter , passover and spring break appear to have spurred more than 142,000 early votes , up from about 90,000 before the first round of voting in february . following michael brown 's death , the national spotlight shone on ferguson , particularly how the city 's predominantly black population is woefully underrepresented in its police force and city council . yet with all the hubbub about the face of civic leadership , only four in 10 city residents hit the polls in november to cast ballots . residents speak out ahead of vote . tuesday 's election will bring change , no matter how the ballots are cast : two black men are running for one of the open seats , and the current lone black council member is n't up for re-election . in another ward , two black women and two white men are vying for an open seat . and a white protester is running for a third post .3\\x1f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe5;cedar falls , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- as aides politely tried to rush ted cruz from an event in cedar falls to one in cedar rapids , iowa , on thursday , the presidential candidate continued shaking hands with anyone who wanted to meet him . finally , after the selfies and conversations started to die down , his aides managed to move him closer to the door when a tall , burly man stopped him . `` senator , '' he said , `` can i pray with you real quick ? '' `` yeah , '' cruz said , as he clasped the man 's upper arm and the two bowed their heads . it was one of the many moments when cruz connected with voters on a religious level last week , as the senator from texas hit the trail in iowa for the first time as a presidential candidate . being the only official contender in the race , cruz drew large crowds during his two-day swing across the state . he 's counting on iowa , known for its vocal and active evangelical base , to propel him forward in what 's expected to be a tough competition among a crowded field of gop candidates . cruz , himself , displays a pastoral swagger when he is speaking on stage and working a room . the senator regularly avoids using a podium , instead favoring pacing the stage with a wireless microphone , a scene reminiscent of a sunday morning sermon . when he meets with people after events , he embraces each one 's hand with both of his , softens his usually theatric tone and looks people square in the eye -- a familiar interaction between churchgoing christians and their pastors . the past two winners of iowa 's caucuses rose to victory with support from the christian right , and cruz , who announced his bid last month at the well-known baptist school liberty university , is aiming to energize that same base and claim the coveted state as his prize . evangelicals make up a large segment of iowa 's republican voter bloc . according to a des moines register/bloomberg politics poll from january , 44 % of likely 2016 republican caucus-goers said they were born-again or evangelical christians . cruz has built a brand as a stalwart conservative willing to buck gop leadership on fiscal issues , but he showed in iowa last week that he 's also eager to champion social issues at a time when many republicans are anxious to avoid them . he was one of the loudest defenders of the religious freedom law in indiana , which came under fire last week for what critics called paving a path to discrimination against gays and lesbians . he described the outrage over the laws as `` shameful '' and an `` assault '' on first amendment rights . `` there are a lot of people here in iowa and across the country whose hearts are breaking , watching what has happened in the last two weeks , '' cruz said friday night at an event in des moines . `` we have seen a grossly unfair vilification of religious liberty . '' related : republican 2016 hopefuls back indiana 's ` religious freedom ' law . he 's more than comfortable talking about his own faith and telling the story of how his father became a christian and a pastor . rafael cruz , who 's become a celebrity among christian conservatives , will frequently visit iowa over the next year , cruz told voters . and cruz 's iowa director , bryan english , is a former pastor . cruz 's first television ads are appearing this weekend during programs on fox news and nbc that are pegged to easter sunday . in the ad , cruz talks about the impact of the `` transformative love of jesus christ '' on his life . while neither mike huckabee , who won iowa in 2008 , nor rick santorum , who won in 2012 , went on to win the nomination , their successes helped launch them into high-profile battles with the then-front-runners . and with both of them likely running again in 2016 , the competition will be stiff . that 's why , for cruz , courting evangelicals is only a component of a three-pronged strategy to win the nomination that also includes dominating the tea party faction and competing for the libertarian base . his stump speech hits on elements that appeal to each faction . he received standing ovations last week for calling to abolish the irs , and , in a knock against the national security agency , he frequently tells audiences to leave their cell phones on so president obama `` can hear every word i have to say . '' cruz argued thursday that the republican party needs to bridge the gap between what he described as the ron paul-rand paul faction of the party -- young libertarian-minded voters -- and the santorum base -- evangelicals . the two blocs , he said , are `` not necessarily the best of chums . '' `` if we 're going to win , we 've got to bring that coalition together , '' he said in cedar falls . `` and i think we can do that . '' cruz frequently says he wants to see a return of the evangelical vote to 2004 levels , when more than six in 10 evangelicals voted in the presidential election , a higher than normal turnout for the demographic . that number has waned slightly since 2004 -- but it 's not too far off from the 56 % of the overall population that voted in 2012 . still , his campaign believes that if it can tap into the group of evangelicals who 've been staying home and get the demographic as a whole to overperform , then that could mean the difference of millions more at the polls . `` if you look at available places for the party to expand the vote , it does n't exist in the middle , it exists in the evangelical vote , '' said rick tyler , a top cruz adviser . `` it is n't a pond , it 's an unfished ocean of available voters who are conservative . '' russell moore , president of the ethics & religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention , said he expects to see record turnout among evangelicals in 2016 no matter who the nominee is or what that person says . moore points to hot-button topics like religious freedom issues in the u.s. , as well as increased attention to the killing of minority christians in the middle east and rising anti-semitism . `` i do n't think a candidate is going to be able to get very far simply by using evangelical lingo or by pointing to his or her personal faith , '' moore said . `` i think a candidate is going to have to explain how he or she would protect religious liberty and would appoint justices and judges who will maintain the common good . '' later in april , voters in iowa will see the bulk of the gop field tackle these issues when they take the stage at an event hosted by the iowa faith and freedom coalition . while the past two winners of the iowa caucuses -- santorum and huckabee -- are likely running for president again , steve scheffler , president of the group , argued that the field is wide open in terms of who 's going to win favor among evangelicals . jeb bush , while not popular among conservative activists , was known for his staunch anti-abortion record as florida governor and touts his catholic faith as a big force behind his policy views . scott walker is the son of a pastor . ben carson , the former neurosurgeon , rose to fame in conservative circles after criticizing the obama administration at a national prayer breakfast . and other likely candidates -- from marco rubio to rick perry to rand paul -- have made serious efforts to court the religious right . `` it 's up for grabs . it 's a clean slate regardless of if you 've run before , '' scheffler said . `` naturally those two -lrb- huckabee and santorum -rrb- have the name recognition and database of people who supported them in the past , but by and large voters are going to say , ` let me take a good look at all of these candidates .

'' `` i feel angry , sad , depressed , numb but most of all i feel like part of me died along with nina leaving tvd . nothing will be the same again , '' twitter user idamonandelena posted . producer julie plec issued a statement supporting dobrev 's decision . `` nina is excited to spread her wings , get some rest , travel the world and also take it by storm , and we support her a thousand-fold , '' she said in the statement , according to media accounts . `` we will miss nina and the four hundred characters she played , but we look forward to the insane and exciting challenge of continuing to tell stories of our salvatore brothers and our much-loved and gifted ensemble .

      "b\"\\xac\\x1ebeijing -lrb- cnn -rrb- china 's state prosecutors on friday formally charged the country 's former security czar with accepting bribes , making him the highest-ranking chinese communist party official ever to face corruption charges . zhou yongkang , 72 , was also charged with abuse of power and leaking state secrets , the supreme people 's procuratorate , the highest prosecution authority in china , said . as a member of the ruling communist party 's politburo standing committee -- china 's top decision-making body -- zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people . he retired in 2012 . at the height of his power , zhou controlled police forces , spy agencies , court systems as well as prosecution offices across china -- and was n't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of `` preserving social stability . '' now , prosecutors have accused zhou of `` taking advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepting huge amounts of money '' during his long political career . his alleged actions have caused heavy losses to public assets and greatly harmed national interests , they added . zhou was notified of his legal rights during the investigation and his lawyer 's views were heard , according to a statement by the prosecutors . his case will be tried in tianjin , a city near the chinese capital , beijing . the president of china 's supreme court recently told reporters there would be `` open '' trials for accused former leaders like zhou . however , the charge of leaking state secrets may allow authorities to shield certain legal proceedings from public view in zhou 's case . zhou has not been seen in public since he attended an anniversary event at his alma mater in october 2013 . he was expelled from the communist party and arrested last december . state media have painted an intricate web of officials , cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer . zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth , in a blatant exchange between money and power . he was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex , state-run xinhua news agency reported last year . analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of chinese politics , now ruled by president xi jinping . xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign , targeting both `` tigers '' and `` flies '' -- high-ranking , and low-level , officials . zhou is by far the biggest tiger caught in xi 's dragnet to date . `` the important thing here is that xi has proven he 's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former politburo standing committee members , '' longtime political analyst willy lam , a professor at the chinese university of hong kong , said last year , when the government revealed its formal investigation into zhou . many observers also note zhou 's patronage of bo xilai , a former communist leader sentenced to life in prison for corruption in 2013 . bo 's spectacular downfall the year before -- complete with tales of murder , bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention . state media have cited his subsequent conviction as a prime example of xi 's resolve to clean up the party . the former chongqing communist party chief 's supporters , however , have long called him a political victim -- the former high-flying politician was once considered xi 's main challenger for the top spot of chinese leadership . political watchers see similarities between the bo and zhou cases . `` the people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles , '' said lam , who has predicted a suspended death sentence for zhou ..\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x88\\x13-lrb- cnn -rrb- do you remember the talk about plans for iraqi-led force to try to take back mosul this spring ? well , you might want to forget it . nearly three months after a u.s. official said up to 25,000 iraqis troops were expected to return to the key northern iraqi city in april or may , a senior official in president barack obama 's administration said thursday that washington is `` not putting a timeframe on '' a possible invasion . it `` might be some time from now . might be soon , '' another senior administration official said . mosul has long been the big prize in the iraqi government 's fight -- aided by a u.s.-led military coalition , which has carried out airstrikes for months -- to defeat isis . it has also long been a source of embarrassment , considering how it fell after iraqi troops dropped their weapons , abandoned their posts and ran for their lives when militants arrived last june . the senior administration officials who talked to reporters thursday stressed the iraqis and their allies are making progress in their fight against the group that calls itself the islamic state . in fact , officials insist that isis has been degraded substantially thanks to a combination of air power and ground combat . the biggest and most recent example of this came with the recapture a few weeks ago of tikrit , the hometown of former iraqi dictator saddam hussein that is located some 100 miles -lrb- 160 kilometers -rrb- north of baghdad . iraqi forces aided by iranian-backed shiite militiamen took that northern city , the same place where isis allegedly massacred iraqi troops last year . still , mosul is n't tikrit . for one thing , it has a lot more people -- about a million , one obama administration official noted . and it 's more important not only to iraq , but isis , meaning the terrorist group has all the more reason to go all-out to defend it . in some ways , the campaign for mosul has begun , according to officials . there are no plans for u.s. combat troops involvement in an eventual operation , they say , but airstrikes have already targeted isis positions in the area . just because the area has been softened up some from the air , though , does n't mean a full ground assault is imminent . calling for `` patience , '' an administration official said that winning mosul is a complex endeavor . it will `` take a lot of capacity , '' the official said , `` and some time to build .

'' santana said he heard the sound of a taser being used . he believed scott was trying to get away from it . but scott never got the taser or used it on the officer , santana told nbc . who was walter scott ? a north charleston police report included brief statements from eight police officers , but not slager . one officer , identified as sgt. j. gann , said in the report he was conducting a separate traffic stop about 9:30 a.m. saturday when he heard -- apparently via radio -- slager say he was `` in foot pursuit '' of another motorist . gann said that while driving to the officer 's location , `` slager advised that he deployed his taser and -lrb- requested -rrb- back up units . '' seconds later , gann reported , he heard slager tell a dispatcher , `` shots fired and the subject is down . he took my taser . '' hours after the shooting , the post and courier of charleston quoted a statement from police spokesman spencer pryor , who said slager attempted to use his taser to stop a fleeing suspect . the men struggled over the device , with the suspect taking the taser and attempting to use it against slager , the newspaper reported . in the police report , another officer , j. banias , said he was heading to the scene about 10 minutes after the initial call . slager asked him to `` secure his vehicle at the site of the traffic stop . '' banias said he spoke to a passenger in the car scott was driving . `` the passenger was ... detained and placed in the back seat of my vehicle , '' the officer reported . the passenger 's identity was not given in the report , but the officer said in the report that the passenger was detained . scott family spokesman ryan julison confirmed to cnn that a man was with scott and said he is not related to the family . the family declined to provide any more information . a timeline of events . the north charleston police department is not providing additional information , citing an ongoing investigation of scott 's killing by the independent south carolina law enforcement division . gann said when he arrived at the shooting scene , an officer identified only as habersham `` was administering first aid '' to scott . `` i exited my vehicle and assisted officer habersham with first aid and cpr to the driver , '' gann said in the report . `` we continued to perform first aid and cpr until ems arrived ... when ems and first responders arrived , ems took care over providing care to the driver , who was pronounced deceased a short time later . '' habersham , in his account , did not mention performing cpr . `` i attempted to render aid to the victim by applying pressure to the gunshot wounds and -lrb- directing -rrb- the best route for ems and fire to get to the victim faster , '' he said in the report . an officer identified as sgt. webb said that he requested an ambulance . webb said that at 9:41 a.m. he saw habersham `` administering chest compression to the defendant . '' north charleston police chief eddie driggers was asked at a news conference this week whether cpr was performed on scott . `` i do not know . i was told that life-saving ... that they tried to save his life , '' driggers said . north charleston mayor keith summey added that not every north charleston police officer is cpr certified . what we know about officer slager .\\xee\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' you see , chokalingam revealed that , as an undergraduate at the university of chicago , he engaged in a daring -lrb- his view -rrb- or ridiculous and offensive -lrb- pretty much everyone else -rrb- scam : he applied to medical school claiming to be african-american . chokalingam had spent his college years as a `` hard-partying frat boy , '' and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 gpa . upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options , he realized that fellow indian-americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice -- but that `` black , hispanic , and native american applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance . '' this revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man , both to `` dramatically improve '' his chances of admission , and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools . to accomplish this goal , chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks , trimmed his `` long indian-american eyelashes , '' checked `` black '' under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname `` jojo . '' he received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools , results that he claims support the notion that african-americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or asians . and now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired , he 's looking to write a book on his experiences , titled `` almost black : the true story of an indian american who got into medical school pretending to be an african american . '' what 's truly curious is that even if you agree with chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of `` systematic racism , '' when all is said and done , it offers very little evidence of the `` privilege '' that he claims is accorded to black , hispanic and native american candidates . chokalingam had mediocre grades and mcats , but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation . yet even while representing himself as black , chokalingam received only a single admission offer , to st. louis university 's school of medicine , which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings . harvard , university of pennsylvania , columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him . meanwhile , he admits , pretending to be black came with disadvantages . he found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops -- who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost , implying that he must have stolen it . these acts of very real prejudice , experienced regularly by blacks and hispanics of all backgrounds -- multimillionaire comedian chris rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason -- did n't seem to dissuade chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making . it 's not just a matter of what individual applicants `` deserve . '' one-third of americans are black , hispanic or native american ; just one in 10 physicians are . since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities , this lack of diversity has produced `` doctor deserts , '' in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians . years ago , when i told my father -- a doctor from a long line of doctors -- that i did n't want to follow in his footsteps , he told me that was fine , because medicine is a service trade , and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession . a medical degree is n't a reward to be earned , he said , but a responsibility to be accepted . which really cuts to the heart of what 's so sad about chokalingam 's racial farce . like others who 've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities -- including putative presidential candidate jeb bush , who registered himself as `` hispanic '' on a 2009 voter form , and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed native american ancestry in the past -- chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people 's burden . race is n't just about color or blood ; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people . many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive ; others are deeply painful . affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation 's history ; an imperfect one , but necessary . there are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own . industries like health care and hollywood . because what 's most ironic about chokalingam 's decision to ride on his sister 's coattails in telling his story : while asians are well represented in medicine , our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world , and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like mindy kaling , it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces , voices and stories . kaling 's immense talent and charisma made her a star . but it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- nbc 's diversity writers program -- that gave her a start .\\xa9\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb8)-lrb- cnn -rrb- `` a long , long , time ago ... '' those five words , when uttered or sung , makes baby boomers immediately think of don mclean 's pop masterpiece `` american pie . '' it 's hard to believe that his phenomenal 8 1/2 minute allegory , which millions of americans know by heart , is 44 years old . all sorts of historical cross-currents play off each other in this timeless song , brilliantly gilded with the unforgettable chorus , which starts as `` bye , bye , miss american pie . '' there is no real way to categorize mclean 's `` american pie '' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad , beer-hall chant and high-art rock . on tuesday , christie 's sold the 16-page handwritten manuscript of the song 's lyrics for $ 1.2 million to an unnamed buyer . mclean was a paperboy when , on february 3 , 1959 , he saw that buddy holly , ritchie valens and j.p. `` the big bopper '' richardson had been tragically killed in an airplane crash in clear lake , iowa . `` the next day i went to school in shock and guess what ? '' mclean recalled . `` nobody cared . rock 'n' roll in those days was sort of like hula hoops and buddy had n't had a big hit on the charts since ' 57 . '' by cathartically writing `` american pie , '' mclean has guaranteed that the memory of those great musicians lives forever . having recorded his first album , `` tapestry , '' in 1969 , in berkeley , california , during the student riots , mclean , a native new yorker , became a kind of weather vane for what he called the `` generation lost in space . '' when his cultural anthem `` american pie '' was released in november 1971 , it replaced bob dylan 's `` the times they are a changin '' as the peoples almanac of the new decade . it 's important to think of `` american pie '' as one would of henry longfellow 's `` evangeline '' or johnny mercer 's `` moon river '' -- an essential americana poem emanating wistful recollection , blues valentine , and youthful protest rolled into one . there is magic brewing in the music and words of `` american pie , '' for mclean 's lyrics and melody frame a cosmic dream , like those jack kerouac tried to conjure in his poetry-infused novel `` on the road . '' don mclean : buddy holly , rest in peace . influenced by pete seeger and the weavers , mclean proudly wore the mantle of troubadour in the early 1970s , when `` american pie '' topped the billboard charts , and has never shed the cape . wandering far and wide , singing `` american pie '' at windblown dance halls in wyoming and cloistered colleges in new england , at huge amphitheaters in california and little coffee houses in the hudson river valley , mclean has performed his global anthem thousands of times . yet the encore number never loses its transfixing allure . when mclean prods audiences by rhapsodizing `` and they were singing '' everybody spontaneously joins in with the `` bye , bye '' chorus . watching mclean deliver his most notable song in concert is to take part in a collective happening . what makes `` american pie '' so unusual is that it is n't a relic from the counterculture but a talisman , which , like a sacred river , keeps bringing joy to listeners everywhere . when `` american pie '' suddenly is played on a jukebox or radio it 's almost impossible not to sing along . like `` danny boy '' or `` streets of laredo '' or `` shenandoah , '' it 's eternal . with illusions to football fields and rock 'n' roll , river levees and nursery rhymes , the song cascades along like a boat going down niagara falls or a roller coaster that jumps tracks but floats instead of crashes . after all these years , `` american pie '' still makes me feel empowered and yet filled with a sense of loss . the song is alive and joyful , yet fretful about a world gone wrong . it is a song that will never die . a reverie for the ages . there is a jump to the chorus , which forces the mind to relive the '50s , '60s and '70s , to troll through the back pages of our lives while , like a traditional irish folksong , it reminds us of fate . while mclean , the muse , has rightfully not tried to interpret `` american pie , '' it 's fair to surmise that `` the king '' is elvis presley , `` helter skelter '' refers to the charles manson murders , the `` jester on the sidelines in a cast '' is bob dylan , and `` jack flash '' the rolling stones . but who knows ? the lyric remains a puzzle open to thousands of spirited interpretations . as a literary artifact of the early 1970s , there is n't anything to compare to `` american pie . '' normally , i do n't like rankings of literature or songs or even presidents , for that matter . but the fact that the recording industry of america and the national endowment of the arts chose `` american pie '' as the fifth greatest song of the 20th century speaks to the composition 's importance as an enduring piece of pop art . the other four were `` over the rainbow '' -lrb- by harold arlen and e.y `` yip '' harburg -rrb- , `` white christmas '' -lrb- by irving berlin -rrb- , `` this land is your land '' -lrb- by woody guthrie -rrb- and `` respect '' -lrb- by otis redding -rrb- . that is fine company . quite simply , `` american pie '' is one of the greatest songs ever written . and tuesday the original lyrics found a new home .\\x87\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' jefferson county circuit court judge laura petro had ordered hinton released after granting the state 's motion to dismiss charges against him . hinton was convicted of murder in the 1985 deaths of two birmingham-area , fast-food restaurant managers , john davidson and thomas wayne vason . but a new trial was ordered in 2014 after firearms experts testified 12 years earlier that the revolver hinton was said to have used in the crimes could not be matched to evidence in either case , and the two killings could n't be linked to each other . `` death row stories '' : hard questions about the u.s. capital punishment system . the state then declined to re-prosecute the case . hinton was 29 at the time of the killings and had always maintained his innocence , said the equal justice initiative , a group that helped win his release . `` race , poverty , inadequate legal assistance , and prosecutorial indifference to innocence conspired to create a textbook example of injustice , '' bryan stevenson , the group 's executive director and hinton 's lead attorney , said of his african-american client . `` i ca n't think of a case that more urgently dramatizes the need for reform than what has happened to anthony ray hinton . '' stevenson said the `` refusal of state prosecutors to re-examine this case despite persuasive and reliable evidence of innocence is disappointing and troubling . '' amnesty report : executions down but death sentences on the rise . dressed in a dark suit and blue shirt , hinton praised god for his release , saying he was sent `` not just a lawyer , but the best lawyers . '' he said he will continue to pray for the families of the murder victims . both he and those families have suffered a miscarriage of justice , he said . `` for all of us that say that we believe in justice , this is the case to start showing , because i should n't have -lrb- sat -rrb- on death row for 30 years , '' he said . woman who spent 22 years on death row has case tossed . hinton was accompanied friday by two of his sisters , one of whom still lives in the birmingham area . other siblings will fly to the area to see him soon , stevenson said . his mother , with whom he lived at the time of his arrest , is no longer living , according to the lawyer . hinton planned to spend at least this weekend at the home of a close friend . he will meet with his attorneys monday to start planning for his immediate needs , such as obtaining identification and getting a health checkup , stevenson said . the plan now is to spend a few weeks to get oriented with freedom and `` sort out what he wants to do , '' stevenson said .\\xd3\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' she did n't disclose the details of the settlement other than saying that `` one important aspect of it was an apology by kanye west to our client , daniel ramos . '' her statement included a picture of west and ramos shaking hands , which she said happened after the apology . the original incident was caught on video , including the following exchange . `` kanye ! kanye ! talk to me , kanye ! '' ramos shouts outside a terminal at the los angeles airport on the night of july 19 , 2013 . `` what 's ' going on ? why ca n't we talk to you ? i mean , why ? '' he asks as west moves through a group of paparazzi . `` now come on , kanye , i do n't want to fight with you , '' he says as west advances toward him . `` i told you , do n't talk to me , right , '' west says . `` you 're trying to get me in trouble so i step off and have to pay you like $ 250,000 . '' west is then seen rushing the photographer and attempting to wrestle his camera from his hands . west retreats after about 15 seconds of scuffling with the photographer . `` we believe that this case sent an important message , '' allred said . `` celebrities are not above the law , and they have no right to physically attack someone simply because they were asked a question . '' beverly hills police investigated an incident in january 2014 in which west was accused of assaulting a man at a beverly hills chiropractor 's office . west avoided criminal charges by reaching a civil settlement with the man . kanye west apologizes to beck , bruno mars . cnn 's sonya hamasaki contributed to this report .\\x92\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x90*-lrb- cnn -rrb- rebekah gregory blinked back tears as she thought about the verdict . it had been almost two years since dzhokhar tsarnaev and his brother planted bombs at the boston marathon , setting off deadly explosions that wounded her and hundreds of others . in court last month , she testified that one of the blasts on that day in 2013 left her lying in the street , staring at her own bones . now , jurors have found him guilty on all 30 counts he faced for the deadly bombings and their aftermath . but no verdict can ever totally make up for the pain , she said . `` i do n't believe that there will ever be justice brought to this , no mater if he does get the death penalty or he remains in prison for the rest of his life , '' she said , crying as she spoke to reporters outside her texas home . `` i do believe , however , that he should be held accountable for his actions . and i 'm very thankful for each of the jury members that are making him do that . '' gregory , who wrote a widely publicized letter to tsarnaev after testifying , said the trial has left her and other victims reeling from a flood of emotions as they relive horrifying memories , but it 's an important step . `` everything is being brought up again full force . our lives will never ever be the same , but i hope with this we can move forward and remember that we are still here for a reason , that there 's a bigger plan , '' she said . `` i may be standing on one fake leg , but i 'm standing here , stronger than ever , because someone tried to destroy me , and he failed . '' for gregory and others who lived through the 2013 attack , wednesday 's verdict brought a mix of emotions , from triumphant vows to move forward , to expressions of gratitude , to debate over whether tsarnaev should be sentenced to death . there were no outbursts inside the federal courthouse in boston . in fact , there was barely any peripheral noise as people sat on the edges of their seats . as tsarnaev fidgeted and scratched the back of his head , some survivors and victims ' family members lowered their heads and dabbed tears . as cnn 's alexandra field noted from inside the courtroom , `` they 've waited a long time for this . '' the family of sean collier , a 26-year-old police officer shot to death in his patrol car on the campus of the massachusetts institute of technology , said tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , were terrorists who `` failed monumentally '' in striking fear in people . `` while today 's verdict can never bring sean back , we are thankful that dzhokhar tsarnaev will be held accountable for the evil that he brought to so many families , '' the collier family said in a written statement . to richard `` dic '' donohue , an mbta police officer left in a pool of blood after being wounded in a shootout with the tsarnaevs in watertown , the verdicts show that `` as a society , ... terrorism will not prevail , and we will hold those accountable for their acts against our nation . '' `` justice has been served today , '' donahue tweeted . survivor karen brassard said she needed to attend the trial to help her heal . she does n't believe dzhokhar tsarnaev 's brother tamerlan , now dead , persuaded him to take part in the plot , as the defense contended . dzhokhar , in her view , was `` all in . '' `` obviously we are grateful for the outcome today , '' brassard tolder reporters . `` it 's not a happy occasion , but it 's something that we can put one more step behind us . '' that sense of turning the page was echoed by bruce mendelsohn , who is among those who rushed to save lives at the marathon finish line . the verdicts mean that dzhokhar tsarnaev is no longer a bombing suspect -- he is now officially a `` convicted killer . '' you ca n't call it celebration . but there is a newfound peace of mind , at least , in and around boston . this was a community that suffered greatly after the bombing and subsequent manhunt . and they got through it by rallying around each other , a deep bond reflected in the mantra `` boston strong . '' that feeling was reaffirmed all around the city by wednesday 's verdict . and it 's evident in people like heather abbott , who lost her left leg below the knee . since then , she 's become a living example of someone who was n't stopped by the terror -- learning not only to walk again , but to run again . `` nothing can ever replace the lives that were lost or changed forever , '' abbott said wednesday on facebook . `` but at least there is some relief in knowing that justice is served and responsibility will be taken . '' that view was commonly shared . for those hurt -- physically , mentally , emotionally -- by the horrors of 2013 , wednesday was key to their progression . but it 's not the end of the road . just ask jeff bauman . the picture of him , bloodied , being rushed through the streets of boston by good samaritan carlos arredondo , became a symbol of the carnage and heroism from this attack . even after losing both his legs , bauman has become a symbol since of resilience -- moving on with his life , by marrying and fathering a child . on wednesday , bauman said the verdict `` will never replace the lives that were lost and so dramatically changed . '' `` but it is a relief , '' he added , `` and one step closer to closure . '' cnn 's ann o'neill and steve almasy contributed to this report .\\xf7\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' mao still divides opinion in china . his giant portrait hangs on beijing 's tiananmen gate , and thousands flock to see his embalmed body at his mausoleum in tiananmen square in the heart of the chinese capital . but despite this reverence , mao 's is a deeply flawed legacy . many remember him as a brutal dictator who inspired fear , paranoia and famine , and whose actions resulted in tens of millions of deaths . cnn 's shen lu contributed to this report .r\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' heads of state from 35 countries in the western hemisphere have met every three years to discuss economic , social or political issues since the creation of the summit in 1994 . cuba has historically been the wrench in the diplomatic machinery , with some latin american leaders threatening not to attend the summit of the americas if the united states and canada did n't agree to invite president raul castro . the tide changed december 17 , 2014 , when president barack obama and castro announced that more than five decades of cold war rivalry was ending . diplomats from both countries immediately began negotiations to establish embassies in havana and washington , and the attention immediately focused on the summit of the americas , where for the first time since the about-face , obama and castro would come face-to-face . the much anticipated handshake between obama and castro would steal all the headlines if it was n't for cuba 's strongest ally , venezuela . venezuelan president nicolas maduro recently accused the united states of trying to topple his government and banned former president george bush , former vice president dick cheney , and senators bob menendez and marco rubio from entering venezuela . `` they ca n't enter venezuela because they 're terrorists , '' maduro said , blaming the american politicians for what he called terrorist actions in iraq , syria and vietnam . the u.s. state department said the allegations of u.s. involvement in a coup plot against maduro were `` baseless and false . '' later , obama issued an executive order sanctioning seven venezuelan officials for human rights violations and saying the country was a `` threat to national security . '' white house officials said every executive order includes that language , but it has sparked a fiery response from maduro , who has been collecting millions of signatures demanding the repeal of the order . he also asked for repeal in full-page ads in the new york times and in a panama city newspaper . maduro did n't stop there ; he has been rallying other latin american leaders , including bolivian president evo morales , ecuador 's rafael correa and nicaragua 's daniel ortega . but perhaps most damning for the united states -- and creating the `` triangle of tension '' at the summit -- cuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez has sided publicly with maduro . `` we reiterate our strong condemnation of the unacceptable and unjustifiable unilateral sanctions imposed against the sister nation of venezuela and the continued foreign interference with the purpose of creating a climate of instability in that sister nation . we ratify our firmest support to the bolivarian revolution and the legitimate government headed by president nicol\\xc3\\xa1s maduro , '' rodriguez said . while the world watches for the photo-op of obama and castro , it 's unclear if more latin american diplomats will side with maduro , and for america , the vii summit of the americas could go from `` mi casa es su casa '' to a walk into the lion 's den .E\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' but the framework announced last week does nothing of the sort . negotiated between iran and the united states , russia , china , britain , france and germany , the framework concedes that iran can maintain `` a mutually defined enrichment program , '' operate thousands of centrifuges , and continue its research and development of nuclear technologies . the deal currently on the table would hand tehran billions of previously sanctioned funds , filling the coffers of the world 's biggest state sponsor of terrorism , with strongholds in syria , iraq , yemen and lebanon . meanwhile , the strictest restrictions on iran 's enrichment will expire in only 10 years , despite the president receiving a letter from 367 members of congress -- both democrats and republicans -- in which we insisted that `` verifiable constraints on iran 's nuclear program must last for decades . '' the president admitted as much when he conceded that `` in year 13 , 14 , 15 , they have advanced centrifuges that enrich uranium fairly rapidly , and at that point the breakout times would have shrunk almost down to zero . '' but as bad as these concessions are , the most concerning aspect of the april 2 deal is that it lacks tough safeguards to stop iran from cheating . the key question is this : will the inspectors at the international atomic energy agency be allowed to inspect these military sites without warning ? because if the iaea can not conduct `` anytime , anywhere '' inspections , iran will be able to `` sneak out '' to a bomb . it has been done before . remember , in 1994 , when president bill clinton told us he had struck a deal with north korea that would `` make the united states , the korean peninsula , and the world safer '' ? president clinton sounded a little too much like the current secretary of state john kerry , when he promised that the north korea agreement `` does not rely on trust '' and that `` compliance will be certified by the international atomic energy agency . '' twelve years after these assurances , north korea detonated its first nuclear bomb . iran could easily do the same . the best predictor of its future behavior is its past behavior -- between 2004 and 2009 , the iranian government built a huge centrifuge facility named fordo under a mountain deep in the iranian desert . luckily for the world , western intelligence agencies discovered tehran 's deception . but we can not rely on such luck in the future , particularly when iran still has n't come clean about its history of secret weapons development and is still dodging basic questions from the iaea . let 's not forget the other things iran has been doing while its diplomats have been bargaining with the u.s. and its partners . while iran was showing its friendly new face to the world , it has simultaneously been helping syrian dictator bashar al assad kill his own people , training and funding the terrorist group hezbollah , which aims to annihilate israel , and supporting the houthis , who started a civil war and overthrew the government in yemen -- one of america 's more reliable counterterrorism partners in the region . if president obama is going to hand over billions of dollars to a regime that behaves like this , run by a man who publicly declares : `` death to america , '' it has to be a better deal . the framework we have before us keeps iran 's nuclear door well and truly open .-\\x17\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xce,waterloo , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- martin o'malley and jim webb share little in common . both democrats are toying with a presidential run , both are facing long odds in that endeavor , and both shared a stage at the polk county democrats awards dinner in des moines , iowa , on friday night . but , as was evident at the dinner , that is where the similarities end . o'malley is a former mayor and maryland governor who seems most at home when he is pressing the flesh at events and introducing himself to anyone who would extend their hand . webb , on the contrary , is a decorated vietnam war veteran and former senator from virginia who comes across as more stoic and , at times , uncomfortable with retail politics . before the event , o'malley confidently cruised the union hall . he took selfies with young environmental activists and chatted with sometimes tepid supporters who admitted their other political allegiances . `` it is a marathon , not a sprint , '' one man told o'malley , a nod to his long odds in the 2016 democratic nomination process . `` yes , it is ; it 's a marathon , '' o'malley responded . `` welcome to iowa , '' said another man . `` we hope to see you here more . '' o'malley smiled , `` thanks a lot . i hope you do , too . '' webb was n't nearly as active , opting instead to stay close to his seat near the front of the venue and chat with a small group of people around him . as webb cut into his sizable helping of pork , o'malley was standing directly behind him , shaking hands . the former virginia senator , after possibly seeing o'malley making the rounds , did stand up and shake hands with a few of the diehard democratic activists in the room . `` seven months old , '' zach smith , a new father , said of his baby boy , noah . `` i have a bunch of kids . the youngest one is 8 years old , '' webb said . the baby looked up at the senator . `` he is pretty calm , '' webb remarked , himself calm . despite coming from bordering states , webb and o'malley do n't know each other . when they passed each other in a des moines hotel lobby on friday morning , it was the first time the two had met . that said , the two democrats find themselves in the same position . hillary clinton , the former secretary of state who is set to announce her presidential bid sunday , leads every national and state poll of the democratic field . she has begun to build a sizable staff and is expected to have massive amounts of money to win the nomination . o'malley and webb are both looking up at her . in a march cnn/orc poll -lrb- pdf -rrb- of national democrats , only 1 % said o'malley and webb were their top choice . in a january poll from bloomberg politics and the des moines register -lrb- pdf -rrb- , o'malley was at 1 % among iowa democrats , while webb found himself at 3 % . the speaking portion of the night further showed webb and o'malley 's differences . webb , who spoke before the governor , gave a more subdued , biographical speech that mentioned three areas he would focus on if he ran for president : basic governance , economic justice and criminal justice reform . to the approval of the audience , webb promised to come back to iowa regularly . `` i am committing to you right now , '' he said , `` we are going to go over the whole state . '' and the biggest applause came near the end of his speech , when he urged his party to get back to talking about issues . `` money is ruining our political process , '' webb said to a chorus of applause and `` hear hear . '' o'malley , on the other hand , gave a speech littered with intentional applause lines . at points , the governor would deliberately stop to allow for the silence to be filled with clapping hands . `` when the american dream is denied , our lives shrink , our hopes fade , and our days unfold not in the light of possibility but in the darkness of fear , '' o'malley said , delivering the same stump speech he usually gives . `` to make the dream true again , we must fight for better wages for all workers , so that americans can support their families on what they earn . '' as the event wound down , webb and o'malley stuck around to shake more hands and meet people . o'malley , who spent the previous day in iowa , left friday night for new york . webb , who is in the midst of a four-day trip to iowa , stayed in des moines and headlined a veterans event on saturday morning in waterloo . webb regularly speaks about his service and appeared more at home at the event . he told war stories with young and old veterans and spoke at length about how the government could be doing more for veterans . he also touted his work on passing the 21st century g.i. bill of rights , a 2008 act that expanded education benefits for veterans , and stressed that more needed to be done . `` you want the next greatest generation , give them the same opportunity the the greatest generation had , '' webb said to applause . `` if you really want to thank them , hire a vet . '' after the event , webb shook hands with people veterans who told stories about dropped benefits and problems with the department of veterans affairs . he occasionally smiled and thanked people for coming on a sunny saturday morning . asked whether he enjoys the retail politics that is crucial in early voting states like iowa and new hampshire , webb smiled . skepticism of retail politics is not new for webb . as a one-term democratic senator , webb was rumored to loathe the burdens that came with campaigning , namely fundraising and retail politics . this time , he put on a rosy view . `` this is the good part of it , `` webb said , with a laugh . `` talking to the media , that is not always the good part .

      "b\"\\x98Fcharleston , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- police officers saturday accompanied the hearse carrying the body of walter scott to his south carolina funeral service , where hundreds of mourners celebrated his life and death as a catalyst for change in america . a pair of officers on motorcycles were part of the large procession delivering the father of four -- who was fatally shot in the back by a police officer -- to a service open to the public . an overflow crowd gathered on a humid and occasionally rainy april afternoon at w.o.r.d. ministries christian center in summerville , which has a capacity of about 300 people . the flag-draped casket of the u.s. coast guard veteran was wheeled inside the church as scott 's relatives and friends followed . some dabbed tears ; others embraced . hundreds , including local officials , assembled inside the packed sanctuary -- in corridors , under an awning at the entrance , wherever they could stand . silence filled the vast space as scott 's daughter samantha read a poem of love dedicated to her father . anthony scott said god had selected his brother as a candidate for change in america . `` the change will come , '' he said , bringing to the crowd to its feet . the head of the church , george hamilton , spoke of how scott had brought members of his family to the church , of the agony of not only losing a family member but having to watch it happen on video . the death of scott , who was black , at the hands of a white police officer was `` motivated by racial prejudice , '' hamilton said . it was `` an act of overt racism . '' `` hate came because walter was an african-american , '' he said . hamilton said his remarks were not meant as an indictment of law enforcement , but he singled out the officer who killed scott as a `` disgrace to the north charleston police department . '' `` there is gong to be change , '' he said . `` walter 's death will not be in vain . '' after the service , pallbearers gently lifted scott 's casket into the hearse . crowds poured from the church . a slow-moving procession of black cars then made its way to live oak memorial gardens in charleston for the private burial . chris stewart , an attorney for the scott family , said the death represented more than an race issue . `` it 's a human issue , '' he said . `` we 're getting emails from people in arkansas telling us , ` i 'm a white male , and i 'm supporting this family . ' their son is going to be remembered for changing the way we look at each other . '' on friday night , scott 's open casket was draped with an american flag , and he was in a dark suit for his private visitation in charleston . a dallas cowboys banner -- his favorite nfl team -- was placed outside the casket , and a figurine of a cowboys player stood at his side . but scott 's family was missing . they needed privacy , said charleston mayor joseph riley , who attended . a week ago , scott was killed in north charleston after getting pulled over for a broken taillight . a passer-by caught the shooting on cell phone video , and officer michael slager was swiftly charged with murder . he was fired and faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted . who was walter scott ? the video shows scott running from an officer , who fires eight shots . scott is struck five times ; he falls to the ground . `` nothing in this video demonstrates that the officer 's life or the life of another was threatened , '' national urban league president marc morial said . `` the question here is whether the use of force was excessive . '' but one witness is speaking of a struggle before the shooting . and at least one expert believes a murder charge may not hold up . on thursday , gwen nichols told cnn 's brian todd that she saw scott and slager scuffling at the entrance to a vacant lot . `` it was like a tussle type of thing , like , you know , like , ` what do you want ? ' or ` what did i do ? ' type of thing , '' nichols said . `` i did n't hear mr. slager saying ` stop ! ' '' nichols ' account has similarities to slager 's . he had told investigators that he had tussled with scott over his taser and that he feared for his safety . a timeline of events . criminal defense attorney paul callan said he believes slager 's defense will play up the reported scuffle in arguing that this is not a murder case . `` defense attorneys will say this was a heat of passion shooting -- -lrb- that -rrb- this was something that he did suddenly after some kind of an altercation , a physical altercation with a suspect , '' callan said . `` and that would constitute manslaughter under law , as opposed to murder , and it makes a huge difference in sentencing . '' in south carolina , a murder conviction requires a measure of premeditation . but the account from the witness who recorded the cell phone video , feidin santana , paints a different picture . he was walking to work when he saw slager on top of scott , he said , who was on the ground . santana said he could hear the sound of a taser in use . he said he did n't see scott go after the taser , as slager initially claimed . he said he believes scott was trying to get away . `` mr. scott never tried to fight , '' santana said . neither the struggle nor the use of a taser was captured on video , because santana started recording shortly after that . investigators from the south carolina law enforcement division found troubling inconsistencies from the very start , it said in a statement . `` we believed early on that there was something not right about what happened in that encounter , '' division chief mark keel said in a statement . `` the cell phone video shot by a bystander confirmed our initial suspicions . '' slager 's lawyer , andy savage , has complained that he `` has not received the cooperation from law enforcement that the media has . '' savage 's office said in a statement that it has yet to receive `` any investigative documents , audio or video tapes , other than a copy of mr. slager 's arrest warrant . '' the news release added that the lawyer has been advised that the police union that slager belongs to `` is no longer involved in the case . '' charleston county sheriff al cannon said slager 's wife , jamie , who is eight months ' pregnant , and his mother had a visit with him at the county detention center friday . slager was being held in isolation and being `` monitored for his mental health , '' cannon said . in a statement , one of slager 's lawyers said the meeting lasted about an hour . `` his wife and mom were tearful but strong , and they were all very grateful for the chance to see him in person , even if separated by a thick pane of glass , '' the statement said . `` they held up family photos -- and even jamie 's ultrasound from earlier that day -- to remind him of all those who love him . throughout the visit , michael was focused on jamie and their baby and was very relieved to know that she is being shown so much love and support by their families . '' a second video , taken from a police dash cam , has also emerged from the day scott died . it shows moments before the shooting , when things seemed to be going smoothly between scott and slager . scott apparently tells the officer that he has no insurance on the vehicle , and slager returns to his car to do paperwork . then scott gets out of the car and runs out of the camera 's frame . scott was the subject of a bench warrant over $ 18,104.43 in unpaid child support at the time of the stop , according to court records . that was why he ran , lawyers for the family said after the funeral service . u.s. rep. james clyburn , d-south carolina , told reporters outside the service that scott lost a $ 35,000-a-year job the first time he was jailed for failing to pay child support . `` he said it was the best job he 's ever had , '' clyburn said . `` now you have to ask ... if you want to collect child support , there 's got to be income . and you ai n't going to make much income from jail . it seems to me that we need to take a look to how to deal with that issue without causing unemployment and the loss of freedom . '' on friday afternoon , police met with a man who was in scott 's car , but the passenger 's name was n't in a police report obtained by cnn . he was detained briefly after the shooting , one officer wrote in the report . scott family attorney chris stewart said he was a co-worker and friend . but he did not identify the passenger by name . on friday , a few mourners trickled into the fielding home for funerals . a white banner with a blue star near scott 's casket displayed his favorite nfl team . it said : `` tradition , the cowboys way . '' `` this is a heartbreaking tragedy for everyone in our community , '' said riley , the mayor . `` it breaks everyone 's hearts . '' cnn 's polo sandoval and martin savidge reported from charleston , and ben brumfield and ray sanchez reported and wrote in atlanta and new york .P\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' i asked . -lrb- at the time i lived far from my home parish . -rrb- i do n't remember how she responded , but the answer about my being able to see father was clearly no . i do n't know if all catholic churches would have shut me out , but i figured , at the time , it was part of the long list of rules the vatican required catholic leaders to follow . i cried for a bit , then decided i would never ask god for anything . clearly , his conduits on earth did not have time for me -- a lifelong catholic -- and sinner -- so why would he ? ever since , i 've considered myself a lapsed catholic . until pope francis . there is something about francis that 's reawakened my faith . and it 's not because he opened the floodgates to allow sin in the eyes of the church . he still argues against things i passionately support , but i find myself -- like many other lapsed catholics -- enthralled . recently i had the pleasure of meeting one of the pope 's newly appointed cardinals . his name is cardinal gerald lacroix . the 57-year-old presides at the basilica cathedral of notre dame in quebec city . one of my first questions : what is it about pope francis ? `` every person is a mystery you know . ... but what 's evident is this man is living with such freedom , such inner freedom . he 's himself . he 's in tune with the lord , '' lacroix told me . `` those close to him say he 's up close to 4 in the morning to prepare his daily mass , which is at 7 in the morning on the weekdays . so that 's almost three hours of prayer , preparation and silence before the lord and the word of god . wow , that really fine-tunes you to start off a day . '' perhaps that 's how the pope stays humble . why he defies tradition and washes the feet of the disabled , women and those of other faiths . why he ordered showers to be built for the poor in st. peter 's square . all of this is appealing , but it 's more than that . in my mind , it 's his tone . when pope francis said , `` if a person is gay and he searches for the lord and has good will , who am i to judge ? '' the comment took me aback . homosexuality has long been a taboo subject for the vatican , yet pope francis uttered those welcoming words . lacroix likened the pope 's approach to jesus . `` jesus did n't judge . jesus did not come as a judge . he came as someone who preached and talked about the love of god . '' those kinds of answers are so different in my experience , but i understand why more conservative catholics worry . if the pope does not judge , then who will tell us who is a sinner and who is not ? `` i hear that sometimes , too , '' lacroix told me . `` i think pope francis is conservative in the right way . you have to be conservative enough to come back to what is the foundation : that 's the gospel . you can not reproach pope francis of not living the gospel , or not preaching the truth of the gospel . '' but is n't homosexuality a sin in the eyes of the church ? `` there is room for everyone . the door is open , '' cardinal lacroix insisted . `` of course you know that the catholic church will never promote same sex marriage , but do we respect homosexual persons ? do we welcome them ? do we accompany them ? of course . but to respect the church and its teaching , which is based on a long tradition and also the word of god , we will not go so far as to bless . but that does n't mean we reject . '' that last sentiment -- `` that does n't mean we reject . '' -- did it for me . i finally understood why pope francis reawakened my faith . i always felt my church would reject me for committing the smallest of sins . like calling a priest at a church that was not my home parish . like not covering my head with a traditional veil at easter . like accidentally eating meat on holy friday . like supporting the use of contraception . but as lacroix told me , jesus walked with sinners until the very end . he did not banish them to fires of hell , for he refused to give up on anyone . the cardinal 's last words to me : `` i 'm trying to do my best on -lrb- the -rrb- local level -- to have an open ear to what the church and world are experiencing . to see how we can today respond to those needs . i want people to see me , and the church , as an open heart to grow together . not a church that 's imposing -- we have nothing to impose -- we have someone to propose : the lord jesus and his gospel . '' i ca n't wait to go church next sunday . and , yes , i will bow my head and pray for forgiveness , and if i 'm worthy , christ 's love .\\xf1\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf1+-lrb- cnn -rrb- mullah mohammed omar is `` still the leader '' of the taliban 's self-declared islamic emirate of afghanistan . that appears to be the primary message of a biography , just published by the taliban , of the reclusive militant who is credited with founding the group in the early 1990s . the taliban 's `` cultural commission '' released the 11-page document in several different translations on the movement 's website , ostensibly to commemorate the 19th anniversary of an april 4 , 1996 , meeting in afghanistan 's kandahar province when an assembly of afghans swore allegiance to omar . several afghan observers say the biography is aimed at dispelling rumors of omar 's demise . `` there have been a lot of rumors lately about him . some people are saying that he is not alive , '' said sayyed muhammad akbar agha , a former taliban insider who has written an autobiography about his days with the movement . `` i think the taliban thought it was an important time to release his biography to give assurances that he is alive and present , '' agha told cnn in a telephone interview . bergen : why u.s. must stay in afghanistan past 2016 . the biography also appears to be an attempt to remind the world of the afghan 's jihadi leadership credentials , at a time when isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi has declared himself `` caliph '' of the world 's muslims . `` the taliban has a huge leadership problem at a critical political moment , '' said graeme smith , a kabul-based analyst for the international crisis group . `` another caliph has announced himself to the world , and the taliban has been silent . and that is getting noticed by militants across south asia . '' omar was famously camera-shy during the taliban 's six-year rule over most of afghanistan . to this day , there are only a handful of photographs of the one-eyed leader . `` he never was actively involved in any of these propaganda campaigns . no publicity . no interviews . he never used the internet , '' said rahimullah yusufzai , a pakistani journalist and expert on afghanistan who once interviewed osama bin laden . omar then all but disappeared after a u.s.-led bombing campaign routed the taliban from kabul in 2001 . washington has offered a $ 10 million reward for his capture . the taliban have released written statements purportedly made by the leader-in-hiding . but years without any video or audio recordings of the fugitive have led to growing speculation that omar may have died . the biography challenges rumors of omar 's death by offering a description of his daily work schedule , which begins with prayers , study of the quran , and then delivering `` orders in a specific way to his jihadi commanders . '' the publication also seeks to fill in some of the gaps about the militant 's early years , including the detail that his `` preferred weapon of choice '' was the rpg-7 , a rocket-propelled grenade . according to the biography , omar was born in 1960 in a village called chah-i-himmat in afghanistan 's kandahar province . his father , a `` well-known and respected erudite and social figure , '' died only five years later , apparently of natural causes . omar studied at a religious school , or madrassa , run by his uncle . the rise of the communist party in afghanistan , and the subsequent 1979 soviet invasion , interrupted the young man 's studies and propelled him into the arms of the armed afghan opposition known as the mujahedeen . for the next decade , omar commanded rebel groups `` against the invading russians and their internal communist puppets , '' according to the biography . along the way , he was wounded a number of times and was blinded in his right eye . in one battle , the biography claims , omar and a fighter named mullah biradar akhund destroyed four soviet tanks , even though they were armed with only four rpg rounds . the taliban biography makes no mention of the fact that the u.s. , allied with saudi arabia and pakistan , helped arm and bankroll the mujahedeen until the soviet army withdrew in defeat in 1989 . afghan historians have documented the rapid rise of the taliban in the chaotic years after the communist government in kabul collapsed in 1992 . the movement of warriors who identified themselves as religious scholars emerged to bring order to a country being ripped apart by rival mujahedeen warlords who battled one another for power . the taliban biography says that omar and his compatriots `` launched their struggle and fight against corruption and anarchy '' after an initial meeting in kandahar in june 1994 . two years later , the taliban captured kabul and began imposing its austere interpretation of islamic law on the rest of the country . while the document denounces the taliban 's post-9 / 11 overthrow at the hands of a u.s.-backed coalition of rival afghan fighters , it makes no mention of the taliban 's alliance with bin laden and al qaeda . during a decade in exile , the saudi-born bin laden continued to release periodic video and audio statements until he was killed by u.s. raid on his hideout in the pakistani city of abbottabad in 2011 . though taliban militants have continued to battle the u.s.-backed government across afghanistan , omar has not been seen or heard from in years . the movement claims he continues to oversee a taliban leadership council , judiciary and nine executive commissions , as well as military commanders who operate in all 34 provinces of afghanistan . exclusive : isis ` recruits afghans ' in chilling video . cnn 's masoud popalzai contributed to this report from kabul , afghanistan .Q\\x1c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xcd5-lrb- cnn -rrb- an amnesty international report is calling for authorities to address the number of attacks on women 's rights activists in afghanistan . the report , entitled `` their lives on the line , '' examines the persecution of activists and other champions of women 's rights not only by the taliban and tribal warlords , but also by government officials . its publication is timely . the brutal murder of farkhunda , a young woman in afghanistan , whose body was burnt and callously chucked into a river in kabul , shocked the world . accused of burning pages from the muslim holy book , the quran , many protested the 27-year-old 's innocence . but what also made international headlines was the fact that for the first time in history , women in afghanistan became pallbearers , hoisting the victim 's coffin on their shoulders draped with headscarves , under the gazes of men ; unreservedly sobbing and shouting messages of women 's solidarity as they marched along the streets . in a country ranked in 2011 by a thomson reuters foundation poll as the most dangerous place in the world for women , this feminist act seemed perilous . latest figures suggest they were risking their lives to be heard . in 2013 , the u.n. assistance mission in afghanistan -lrb- unama -rrb- released statistics that showed the number of women killed in the country had increased by 20 % from the previous year , although the number of civilian victims had decreased , said amnesty in the report . the special representative of the u.n. secretary-general in afghanistan at the time , jan kubis , told the u.n. security council that `` the majority -lrb- of women killed -rrb- is linked to domestic violence , tradition , culture of the country . `` women activists have been deliberately targeted . '' and according to the human rights group , little support has come from those in power . `` the afghan government has done very little to protect them , '' amnesty 's afghanistan researcher , horia mosadiq , tells cnn . `` perpetrators almost always walk free , and threats reported by women rights defenders are often simply ignored . `` many women defenders we spoke to said that even when they received some protection from authorities , it was often significantly less than what male counterparts or colleagues were afforded . '' during the attack on farkhunda , `` many eyewitnesses have testified that police officers stood idly by while this woman was being lynched and killed , '' says mosadiq . twenty-six people were arrested and thirteen police officials suspended in connection with the attack , but she argues that this is insufficient . `` suspending police officers is not enough , those who failed in their duty must also be held to account -- anything less will just encourage further mob violence . '' but what is striking is the resilience of the activists , who continue their work despite their lives being on the line . `` it was a remarkable moment , '' says mosadiq , recalling the female protesters at farkhunda 's funeral . `` unlike anything i have seen in my decades of campaigning for women 's rights in our country . '' selay ghaffer , 32 , is a women 's rights activist and spokesperson for the solidarity party of afghanistan -- a small but outspoken political party based in kabul and twenty provinces that fights for issues such as democracy , social justice and women 's rights . the party was the first to be banned in the country for accusing afghan leaders and commanders of war crimes and demanding that they be brought to justice . taking part in farkhunda 's funeral and protests against her death , she tells cnn that despite the onslaught of violence against afghan women over the years , this was the worst case . but the opportunity was taken to deliver a clear message . `` so the women of afghanistan showed that we will not keep silent anymore ... and we are not ready to accept more brutality and violence against women , '' said ghaffer . `` so this is why we decided to carry the dead body of farkhunda on our own shoulders and show to the world that not only men can do it and somehow broke the traditionalism that -lrb- a -rrb- man has to do this job . '' surprisingly , she says that male onlookers supported their mission , although they are in the minority overall in the country . `` men -lrb- at the funeral -rrb- , they said you have to do this , because this is how you can change the hatred in afghanistan . `` without men , it is not possible for women to get their rights , '' she says . `` so these men and women were working together . but at the same time , women need to step forward for their rights . '' mosadiq says the fight for women 's rights was established a while ago . `` women 's activism in afghanistan is nothing new -- the women 's rights movement has grown substantially since 2001 , and has fought for and achieved some very significant gains . `` these gains are under threat now , however , and some are even rolled back . it 's essential that the government and its international partners do not allow this to happen . '' ghaffer herself has been subject to threats because of her work , received through emails and phone calls , at her home and office . but she says she knew what she was getting herself into . `` i knew it was n't an easy task . there might be many challenges and you have to lose your life when you are going and struggling for your rights . `` as a woman , i want to struggle more -lrb- for my rights -rrb- , i want to have more people around me , to struggle with me . '' mosadiq says it is too soon to talk about a revolution , although the response to farkhunda 's killing , from both men and women , has been a `` silver lining . '' ghaffer , however , believes this is the beginning of an uprising -- but she says it needs to keep moving . interestingly , it was a man in her life that motivated her to fight . `` i must say strongly that it was my father -lrb- who inspired me -rrb- , who is not any more with me , because he ... died three months ago , '' she says . `` he always told me that women always suffered in this country , '' she says , her voice overcome with emotion . `` and you have to struggle for your rights . because in this traditional , patriarchal society , nobody will give these rights -lrb- to -rrb- you . '' she realizes how lucky she is , she adds , in a society where she has witnessed men -- fathers and husbands -- oppressing women as opposed to being their role models . ghaffer maintains that silence is an injustice to women , not least to the victim of the recent , horrific mob violence . `` so if i should not do it , if another sister is not doing it , then who will do it ? who will get the rights for us ? we have to struggle for it . `` if we keep our silence , more farkhundas will be killed in this country .

      "b\"\\xac2-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton is finally announcing her candidacy for the 2016 presidential election . although she has watched her standing in the polls sag in recent months , there is likely to be a boost in the days that follow the announcement . for democrats , there is ample reason to be excited about clinton 's run for the presidency . she is certainly one of the strongest candidates in many decades . she brings to the table extensive political and policy experience , a combination of skills that is often lacking . she has been through some of the roughest partisan wars and emerged stronger than ever before . she has a keen sense about the nature of the modern news media , how to use it to her advantage and how to survive scandal frenzies . she is a hardened , tough partisan who will not shy away from republican attack . americans have many positive memories of clinton name , given the booming economy of the late 1990s during bill clinton 's presidency . if hillary clinton puts together an effective campaign , she could be unbeatable in the democratic primaries as well as in the general election . however , during the buildup to her final decision , some of her weaknesses have also been exposed . clinton does n't want to end up like vice president al gore in 2000 . although he did relatively well in the final election -lrb- with many americans believing that he did actually defeat george w. bush -rrb- he did n't generate much energy once the campaign started . although he too was touted as a `` perfect '' candidate who was the ideal person for the job , something seemed stiff and inauthentic when he actually hit the trail . he seemed to freeze when the television cameras were rolling . gore had trouble connecting with voters , and he seemed to remake his image constantly . his biggest asset ended up being that he was viewed as the inevitable nominee , rather than what he actually stood for . clinton must avoid following gore 's path . she suffered this fate in the 2008 primaries and ca n't afford to do so again . she needs to do more than rest on the perception that her candidacy is inevitable and on her record of experience . that is not enough . more important is for her to put forth an exciting vision about what she would stand for in the white house . voters thirst for signs of greatness when they pick their presidents , even if they are savvy enough to understand that the reality of a polarized washington will probably limit her ability to achieve bold change . a recent story in the washington post suggests that her advisers are aware of this potential liability . after the announcement , they are going to avoid big rallies and events and instead concentrate on smaller events where she will meet with voters directly in states such as iowa and new hampshire . clinton also will have to contend with doubts about her authenticity . in his first day on the campaign trail , sen. rand paul immediately tapped into these concerns by raising questions about whether she could be trusted . that question has dogged the clintons ever since they came onto the national political scene in the late 1980s . their greatest virtue , their immense skills as politicians , has often come back to haunt them . bill clinton was attacked as `` slick willie '' by members of both parties for the perception that he would say anything to win and hillary clinton has faced similar criticism . when she tried to distance herself from her vote for the use of force in iraq , many democrats did n't buy her critique of president george w. bush 's foreign policies and went for barack obama instead . when she conducted her `` listening tour '' of new york before running for the senate , many voters saw it as a manufactured effort to hide the fact she was running for office as an outsider . when she explained that there was nothing to the recent stories about her use of a private email server rather than her state department email , some felt that even if the story was relatively minor it indicated that she was n't always telling us what she was really about . even if she is n't hiding anything , she often gives that appearance . during the next few months , clinton will also have to connect with her party 's base . the ongoing speculation about sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts has suggested that the most active part of the democratic party is not that enthused with clinton 's candidacy . while they will probably vote for her , they are not very motivated and do n't trust that she will stand for democratic values . she will need to address these concerns , not through her style but through her agenda . voters will want to hear her talking about issues such as tougher financial regulation and policies to diminish economic inequality as well as her positions on race and policing . she will also need to make clear that she has heard voters on being too hawkish about going to war and give clear indications about how she would handle a nuclear agreement with iran . clinton will also have to contend with the gender bias that still exists in the electorate at large . without any doubt she will be subject to questions and comments -- about her appearance , for instance -- that wo n't be aimed at male candidates . part of her candidacy is itself an effort to break down these remaining vestiges of political sexism . but the struggle will be tough . finally , and this relates to the last challenge , clinton will have to contend with her husband . to be sure he can be an immense force on the campaign trail , one of the most compelling democrats of our generation . but he can also be liability . as she learned in 2008 , bill clinton is not always easy to control . when he speaks his mind , as he did in dismissive comments about obama 's candidacy , it can often work against her . the fund-raising records of the clinton foundation will also raise questions about conflict of interest , and ongoing stories about his personal life , as was the case when monica lewinsky returned to the media a few months ago , could re-emerge on the campaign trail . whether that is fair or not is beside the point : everything is fair game on the modern campaign trail . hillary clinton has the potential to be a hugely successful presidential candidate . but she and her campaign team will need to address the multiple questions and weaknesses that have become clear in recent months .9\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf1\\x14des moines , iowa -lrb- cnn -rrb- martin o'malley told reporters in iowa on friday that inevitability -- a term bandied about regarding democratic presidential frontrunner hillary clinton -- is not unbreakable . `` i 've seen it before , '' the former governor of maryland and possible presidential contender said . `` history is full of examples where the inevitable frontrunner was inevitable right up until she was no longer or he was no longer inevitable . '' clinton was considered inevitable to win the nomination in 2008 but ended up losing to barack obama . o'malley had previously dropped the inevitability comment in a television interview last month . the former governor , who capped off his two-day trip to the first-in-the-nation caucus state with a speech to the polk county democrats in des moines , said that although clinton is an `` eminently qualified candidate , '' the democratic party is full of `` good leaders . '' `` history is full of examples where people who are not very well known nationally can be very well known once they are willing to make their case to the people of iowa , '' o'malley said . in some polls , he has scored in the low single digits in the state . in a march cnn/orc poll of national democrats , only 1 % picked o'malley . in a january poll by bloomberg politics and the des moines register , o'malley was also at 1 % among iowa democrats . clinton , who leads most polls by upwards of 40 points , is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on sunday through a video message on social media , a person close to her campaign-in-waiting told cnn on friday . while he would n't say much about clinton , when asked about her candidacy , o'malley said , `` if leaders believe that they have the experience and the framework to move our country forward , they should run . and they should engage with voters and our country would be the better for it . '' o'malley , like other democrats , appears to refrain from directly attacking clinton . although last month on abc , he said that the presidency is `` not some crown to be passed between two families , '' he has not focused on her . he has , however , openly teased a presidential run . `` i know that , as democrats , we expect -- and i have heard this all over the country -- the democrats expect a robust conversation about the issues we face as a nation and the challenges we face , '' he said . `` they believe that that conversation needs to take place in something as important as a presidential primary . '' he concluded : `` it would be an extreme poverty indeed if there was only one person willing to compete for our party 's nomination for president .

      "b\"\\xc5\\x19-lrb- cnn -rrb- when photographer johan bavman became a father for the first time , he took more than a passing wonder about how his native sweden is said to be the most generous nation on earth for parental leave . he immersed himself in fatherhood -- twice over , you might say . he used his photography to document the real-life experience of other fathers taking full advantage of sweden 's extraordinary program , which allows mothers and fathers to take long , long leaves from their careers so they can care for their newborns . get this : sweden grants a total of 480 calendar days of parental leave , with 390 of them paid at 80 % of income , with a maximum of 3,160 euros a month or $ 3,474 . the remaining 90 days are paid at a flat-rate benefit of 20 euros a day , or $ 22 . but there 's a catch . fathers have to share that leave with mothers . so to promote both parents to raise their children , sweden has mandated that 60 of the 480 days be `` daddy months '' or `` partner months . '' if the 60 daddy days are n't used , they are lost , reducing the maximum leave to 420 days . the country also created a `` gender equality bonus '' : the more days that parents share the leave equally , they get a bonus that could total up to 1,500 euros , or $ 1,649 . the idea is for both parents to share the joys and struggles of raising infants . in reality , only 12 % of swedish couples equally share the 480 days of leave , bavman said , with women continuing to lead the way as the stay-at-home parent and men as the careerist . still , bavman mused last summer about how the policy impacts those men who use the full measure of their parental leave . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . at first , bavman had difficulty finding such men . but the fathers he did find and photograph , he captured their devotion in realistic imagery . `` i realized while i was talking to these dads , these dads are struck by how important the bonding is between you and the children , '' said bavman , who now has a 3-year-old son , viggo , with partner linda stark , a freelance journalist . `` i did n't want to bring out fathers as superdads , '' bavman said . `` i wanted to bring out these role models which people can connect to . `` i want to have those dads who can also show their tiredness ... which comes with being home with your children . it 's a hard full-time job . this is something that we have been taking for granted for hundreds of years . this is something that mothers have never been recognized for . '' he also found moments of humor , with one child nearly ripping apart the shirt of his busy father . the fathers have become more understanding of their wives and even their own mothers , bavman said . some are now considering a career change to accommodate their parenthood . `` being home nine months , they get time to think about their life , '' the photographer said . bavman is looking for a total of 60 fathers to photograph , to culminate in an exhibition and a book . so far he 's found 35 worthy of his lens . johan bavman is a freelance photographer based in malmo , sweden . from 2008-2011 , he worked as a staff photographer at sydsvenskan , one of sweden 's largest newspapers .l\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b'\\xb8\"-lrb- cnn -rrb- a year after its cannes debut and finally seeing a theatrical release , `` lost river \\'\\' is still causing quite a stir . booed at its premiere and mocked by reviewers , ryan gosling \\'s first feature as director has been divisive , to put it mildly . but there has been one shining light cutting through the fog of critical hyperbole : its setting , a besmirched and decaying detroit . wavering on the brink of annihilation , yet providing kindling for its own rebirth , the city is captured in all its waning splendor , the perfect backdrop for gosling \\'s post-industrial gothic . speaking about the film in london , gosling made clear that the city was at the heart of the project -- in fact , without detroit \\'s crumbling edifices there would be no film at all . gosling said that `` lost river \\'\\' began as a collection of speculative shots of the brewster-douglass projects , the first black social housing development in america and a place motown legends the supremes and boxer joe louis once called home . `` i heard -lsb- the authorities -rsb- were going to tear them down , \\'\\' gosling said . `` i had to shoot them before they did . \\'\\' taking time out between acting jobs , he ventured into the projects . `` i started shooting more and more , \\'\\' he explained , `` and then i realized that i was making a film . then i started writing -lsb- the script -rsb- during the process of filming . \\'\\' gosling \\'s affection for the motor city is longstanding , the actor growing up `` not too far away \\'\\' in cornwall , ontario . `` it seemed like everything cool came from detroit ... the whole american dream , \\'\\' he reminisces . `` the model-t , motown , the refrigerator ... \\'\\' now though he references `` 40 miles of dead neighborhoods , \\'\\' the city declaring bankruptcy . `` houses are burning and things are being torn down , \\'\\' he says , `` and within that there are families trying to hold on to their homes . for them it has become a nightmare and i wanted to make a film about that . \\'\\' the title itself alludes to a once thriving community now displaced , its homes at the bottom of a reservoir built with little concern for the residents -- man-made interference with untold social repercussions . speaking in broader terms , gosling argues `` there are lost rivers everywhere and we wanted to share the experience these people were having . \\'\\' on screen he paints a nihilistic image of wanton destruction ; torched properties and bulldozers jostling for our attention amid acts of extreme human violence -- sometimes self-inflicted . the director plainly states that as a location it `` was pretty dangerous . \\'\\' he describes `` an energy there that was threatening ... we had a very charmed experience -lsb- filming -rsb- . it worked its way into the fabric of the movie -- a tone of impending threat that was just there . \\'\\' however there are signs of humanity and regeneration amongst the chaos , on camera and off . for the film \\'s young protagonist , every raid on an unoccupied house offers copper piping waiting to be recast and ultimately reclaimed . similarly , gosling references the heidelberg project during the discussion , a community organization in the city \\'s mcdougall-hunt neighborhood , reimagining derelict buildings as giant canvases for budding artists . he recalls seeing `` one house covered with teddy bears , another covered in clocks ... people taking spaces and personalizing them . \\'\\' the city \\'s scope for urban renewal was clearly a draw . `` something really interesting is happening in detroit at the moment -- a rebirth . people redefining what they are , \\'\\' according to gosling . `` there \\'s a resilience there and an energy , and it \\'s exciting . \\'\\' as much as the visual content of `` lost river \\'\\' revolves around a maudlin preoccupation with dereliction -- and perhaps plays on the outside world \\'s perception of detroit -- aspects of the narrative suggest hope and the possibility of reincarnation for the city . gosling claims this paradox should exist when discussing detroit , and is precisely what the film is trying to convey . `` we want people to know that dereliction is happening there , but that it \\'s not only what is happening there , \\'\\' he argues . `` it does n\\'t define detroit , it \\'s just part of what it \\'s dealing with right now . \\'\\' `` lost river \\'\\' receives a limited theatrical release in the u.s. and uk on april 10 .\\x0e\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

      "b\"\\xc3\\x13-lrb- cnn -rrb- all elizabeth sedway wanted was to leave paradise and head home . but she could n't . why ? because , according to her , she has cancer . that 's what she said in a video posted to facebook that shows her group packing up from their alaska airlines plane as it sat at the gate in hawaii . `` you 're taking me off the airplane because i do n't have a doctor 's note saying i can fly , '' a woman is heard saying . `` all these people are waiting , and i 'm being removed as if i 'm a criminal or contagious , because i have cancer and no note to fly .

'' ... while our employee had the customer 's well-being in mind , the situation could have been handled differently . '' her cancer fight notwithstanding , sedway was in hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary . still , on monday , she was on a plane to head east . then , according to her facebook post , an airline employee who saw sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing . the second time she inquired , sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak . that was followed by a call to a doctor , then her removal from the plane . egan , the alaska airlines spokeswoman , acknowledged that the carrier 's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call medlink , a group of er nurses and doctors . the idea , she explained , is that `` it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air , especially on flights to or from hawaii '' -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean . the decision to pull sedway from the flight was done with `` the customer 's well-being '' in mind , according to egan . still , that does n't mean it was the right decision . alaska airlines since apologized to sedway `` for the disruption this has caused , '' in addition to refunding her family 's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations . '' even though she was stuck in hawaii , sedway made clear on facebook that this was a real `` disruption . '' `` because of this , i will miss my chemotherapy , my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings , '' she said .\\x1b\\x1b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b'\\x9c4-lrb- cnn -rrb- it took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former nfl star aaron hernandez killed semi-pro player odin lloyd . on monday , hernandez \\'s defense gave its side of the story , wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day . hernandez , 25 , is on trial for the shooting death of lloyd , whose body was found in a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013 . now that the defense has rested , it wo n\\'t be long before the jury begins deliberating . much of the evidence in the former new england patriots \\' case is circumstantial . here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on tuesday : . as news spread that hernandez was under investigation in june 2013 , patriots owner robert kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after lloyd \\'s death . `` he said he was not involved , \\'\\' kraft testified last week . `` he said he was innocent , and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club . \\'\\' there \\'s only one potential problem with that claim : the time lloyd was killed had n\\'t been made public yet by the time hernandez met with kraft . so how could hernandez have known when lloyd was killed ? `` what a great , great witness for the prosecution , \\'\\' cnn legal analyst mel robbins said . `` basically what happened is aaron hernandez lied to his boss . and the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand . \\'\\' when questioned by a defense attorney , kraft said that he \\'d never had any problems with hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him . hernandez \\'s fiancee , shayanna jenkins , revealed for the first time last week that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple \\'s home that she said reeked of marijuana . she also said she did n\\'t know what was in the box . that revelation may contradict the prosecution \\'s contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box . the murder weapon in the case has not been recovered . during cross-examination by the defense , jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled `` skunky . \\'\\' earlier , she told prosecutors during direct examination that she did n\\'t know what was in the box . she said hernandez never told her , and she never looked . after concealing the box with her daughter \\'s clothing , jenkins said she threw it away in `` a random dumpster \\'\\' but could not remember exactly where . much testimony has focused on the shoes hernandez wore the night lloyd was shot . a nike consultant testified that hernandez was wearing nike air jordan retro 11 lows . about 93,000 pairs of that shoe were made , significantly fewer in a size 13 . the shoe \\'s sole makes a distinct impression , said lt. steven bennett of the massachusetts state police . the consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney jamie sultan that other nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression . yet bennett , who works in crime scene services , testified that the footprint left near lloyd \\'s body was `` in agreement \\'\\' or consistent with the air jordan retro 11 lows size 13 . although he did not have the shoes that hernandez wore that night , he used an identical pair to make his determination . bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression . jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression . what may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney jamie sultan . sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints . he introduced a march 2014 investigative report written by bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison . prosecutors used grainy footage from hernandez \\'s home security system to suggest he was holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd . hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from hernandez \\'s home . `` in my opinion , the firearm shown in the video stills is a glock pistol , \\'\\' glock sales manager kyle aspinwall testified . the video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving . hernandez \\'s lawyers then showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand , suggesting it may be an ipad . `` glock pistols do n\\'t have white glows to them , do they ? \\'\\' defense attorney james sultan asked . `` no , they do not , \\'\\' aspinwall answered . sultan then displayed a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a glock , suggesting it could also be the object hernandez is holding . hernandez has pleaded not guilty in lloyd \\'s death . but already , his arrest has led to deep consequences , including his release from the new england patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings . so what might make a young man who had signed a $ 40 million contract risk everything ? prosecutors have said lloyd might have done or said something that did n\\'t sit well with hernandez . they claimed hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score . hernandez \\'s co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . but the case gets more complicated . evidence collected in lloyd \\'s death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston . hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub . that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before lloyd was killed . prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing lloyd the spot where that double murder happened . during trial , prosecutors suggest a text written by hernandez the day before the murder saying he was `` buggin \\'\\' for showing lloyd `` the spot \\'\\' may have played a role in plotting to kill lloyd . the judge has banned any mention of the double murder in lloyd \\'s trial , ruling it is prejudicial . hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well . but when the lloyd trial ends , that murder trial awaits him . cnn \\'s jason hanna , lawrence crook , laura dolan and catherine e. shoichet contributed to this report .i\"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

      "b\"\\xaaB-lrb- cnn -rrb- for 12 years adelma cifuentes felt worthless , frightened and alone , never knowing when her abusive husband would strike . but as a young mother in rural guatemala with three children and barely a third grade education , she thought there was no way out . what began as psychological torment , name-calling and humiliation turned into beatings so severe cifuentes feared for her life . one day , two men sent by her husband showed up at her house armed with a shotgun and orders to kill her . they probably would have succeeded , but after the first bullet was fired , cifuentes ' two sons dragged her inside . still , in her deeply conservative community , it took neighbors two hours to call for help and cifuentes lost her arm . but the abuse did n't stop there . when she returned home , cifuentes ' husband continued his attacks and threatened to rape their little girl unless she left . that 's when the nightmare finally ended and her search for justice began . cifuentes ' case is dramatic , but in guatemala , where nearly 10 out of every 100,000 women are killed , it 's hardly unusual . a 2012 small arms survey says gender-based violence is at epidemic levels in guatemala and the country ranks third in the killings of women worldwide . according to the united nations , two women are killed there every day . there are many reasons why , beginning with the legacy of violence left in place after the country 's 36-year-old civil war . during the conflict , atrocities were committed against women , who were used as a weapon of war . in 1996 , a ceasefire agreement was reached between insurgents and the government . but what followed and what remains is a climate of terror , due to a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and discrimination . military and paramilitary groups that committed barbaric acts during the war were integrated back into society without any repercussions . many remain in power , and they have not changed the way they view women . some 200,000 people were either killed or disappeared during the decades-long conflict , most of them from indigenous mayan populations . nearly 20 years later , according to the security sector reform resource centre , levels of violent crime are higher in guatemala than they were during the war . but despite the high homicide rate , the united nations estimates 98 % of cases never make it to court . women are particularly vulnerable because of a deep-rooted gender bias and culture of misogyny . in many cases , femicide -- the killing of a woman simply because of her gender -- is carried out with shocking brutality with some of the same strategies used during the war , including rape , torture and mutilation . mexican drug cartels , organized criminal groups and local gangs are contributing to the vicious cycle of violence and lawlessness . authorities investigating drug-related killings are stretched thin , leaving fewer resources to investigate femicides . in many cases , crime is not reported because of fear of retaliation . many consider the guatamalen national civil police , or pnc , corrupt , under-resourced and ineffective . even if a case does get prosecuted , according to human rights watch , the country 's weak judicial system has proved incapable of handling the explosion in violence . perhaps one of the biggest challenges facing women in guatemala is the country 's deeply rooted patriarchal society . according to mar\\xc3\\xada machicado ter\\xc3\\xa1n , the representative of u.n. women in guatemala , `` 80 % of men believe that women need permission to leave the house , and 70 % of women surveyed agreed . '' this prevailing culture of machismo and an institutionalized acceptance of brutality against women leads to high rates of violence . rights groups say machismo not only condones violence , it places the blame on the victim . the political will to address violence against women is slow to materialize . `` politicians do n't think women are important , '' says former secretary general of the presidential secretariat for women elizabeth quiroa . `` political parties use women for elections . they give them a bag of food and people sell their dignity for this because they are poor . '' lack of education is a major contributor to this poverty . many girls , especially in indigenous communities do n't go to school because the distance from their house to the classroom is too far . quiroa says `` they are subject to rape , violence and forced participation in the drug trade . '' although the situation for girls and women in guatemala is alarming , there are signs the culture of discrimination may be slowly changing . with the help of an organization known as cicam , or centro de investigaci\\xc3\\xb3n , cifuentes was finally able to escape her husband and get the justice she deserved . he is now spending 27 years behind bars . cifuentes is using her painful past to provide hope and healing to others through art . since 2008 , she and four other abuse survivors known as la poderosas , or `` the powerful , '' have been appearing in a play based on their real life stories . the show not only empowers other women and discusses the problem of violence openly , but it also offers suggestions for change . and it 's having an impact . women have started breaking their silence and asking where they can get support . men are reacting , too . one of the main characters , lesbia t\\xc3\\xa9llez , says during one presentation , a man stood up and started crying when he realized how he had treated his wife and how his mother had been treated . he said he wanted to be different . the taboo topic of gender-based violence is also being acknowledged and recognized in a popular program targeting one of guatemala 's most vulnerable groups , indigenous mayan girls . in 2004 , with help from the united nations and other organizations , the population council launched a community-based club known as abriendo oportunidades , or `` opening opportunities '' . the goal is to provide girls with a safe place to learn about their rights and reach their full potential . senior program coordinator alejandra colom says the issue of violence is discussed and girls are taught how to protect themselves . `` they then share this information with their mothers and for the first time , they realize they are entitled to certain rights . '' colom adds that mothers then become invested in sending their daughters to the clubs and this keeps them more visible and less prone to violence . the guatemalan government is also moving in the right direction to address the problem of violence against women . in 2008 , the congress passed a law against femicide . two years later the attorney general 's office created a specialized court to try femicides and other violent crimes against women . in 2012 , the government established a joint task force for crimes against women , making it easier for women to access justice by making sure victims receive the assistance they need . the government has also established a special 24-hour court to attend to femicide cases . on the global front , the international violence against women act was introduced in the u.s. congress in 2007 ; it has been pending ever since . but last week the act was reintroduced in both the house and senate . if approved , it would make reducing levels of gender-based violence a u.s. foreign policy priority . pehaps the most immediate and effective help is coming from international nongovernmental organizations , which are on the front lines of the fight against gender-based discrimination in guatemala . ben weingrod , a senior policy advocate at the global poverty fighting group care , says , `` we work to identify and challenge harmful social norms that perpetuate violence . our work includes engaging men and boys as champions of change and role models , and facilitating debates to change harmful norms and create space for more equitable relationships between men and women . '' but the job is far from over . while there is tempered optimism and hope for change , the problem of gender-based violence in guatemala is one that needs international attention and immediate action . cifuentes is finding strength through the theater and the support of other abuse survivors , which has allowed her to move forward . but millions of other women trapped in a cycle of violence are facing dangerous and frightening futures . for them , it 's a race against time and help can not come soon enough .[\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfc\\x18-lrb- cnn -rrb- a federal grand jury has charged millionaire real estate heir robert durst , a convicted felon , with unlawful possession of a firearm . in this week 's indictment , durst , 71 , is accused of possessing a .38 caliber revolver , which authorities allegedly found in his hotel room last month . he faces a maximum of 10 years in prison if found guilty of that charge , according to the indictment . the charge is the latest in a litany of accusations . a louisiana judge ruled last month that durst , who is charged with first-degree murder , will be held without bail at a facility near new orleans . durst was featured this spring in `` the jinx , '' a hbo documentary about him . he 's accused of killing his friend susan berman at her home in california in 2000 . he also faces state weapons and drugs charges in new orleans . last month , court documents claimed that durst had a loaded .38 - caliber revolver , marijuana , his passport and birth certificate , a latex mask with salt-and-pepper hair attached and more than $ 40,000 cash . he also had a ups tracking number . the package was intercepted by the fbi , prosecutors said , and it contained clothing and more than $ 100,000 in cash . but the bigger courtroom fight will probably unfold in los angeles , where the district attorney filed a first-degree murder charge against durst last month . he awaits extradition to los angeles to face that charge . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . prosecutors accuse durst of `` lying in wait '' and killing berman , a crime writer and his longtime confidante , because she `` was a witness to a crime . '' berman was shot in the head in her beverly hills home in december 2000 , shortly before investigators were set to speak with her about the 1982 disappearance of durst 's first wife , kathleen mccormack durst . durst has long maintained that he had nothing to do with berman 's death or his wife 's disappearance . it 's not the first time he has been accused of murder . he admitted killing and dismembering his neighbor at a 2003 trial , but he was acquitted after arguing that he acted in self-defense . fbi agents have also asked local authorities to examine cold cases in locations near where durst lived over the past five decades , a u.s. law enforcement official said . unsolved cases in vermont , upstate new york , the san francisco bay area and southern california are among those getting a new look , the official said . durst 's attorney , dick deguerin , said it 's a sign that authorities are desperate . deguerin has said durst has serious medical conditions . he is suffering from hydrocephalus , which required brain surgery a couple of years ago , deguerin said . doctors implanted a stent on the right side of his head , the attorney said . `` at the same time he was in the hospital , he had an operation on his esophagus to remove cancer . so he 's got some serious health issues . ... he 's lost a lot of weight . he 's not in good health , '' deguerin said . deguerin also said that durst is `` mildly autistic '' and has received treatment in the past from one of the country 's leading experts in asperger 's syndrome and autism .\\x88\\x1f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd5<-lrb- cnn -rrb- change is coming to ferguson . in the next few weeks the department of justice -lrb- doj -rrb- will begin to negotiate in earnest with the city to restructure the police department , which the department has charged with engaging in a pattern and practice of racial discrimination . it should not be forgotten that the doj review of the ferguson police department was precipitated by months of protests and activism following the killing of michael brown by a ferguson police officer and by revelations about the town 's dysfunctional government and court system by local civil rights law groups . now , after a half year of unrest , and with citizens on tuesday electing two new black city council members , change is beginning to come to ferguson . the question is , what kind of change ? the report from the department of justice offered a devastating insight into a police department and court system that preyed on its own citizens . through illegal traffic stops and arrests , and the use of excessive force , the police department held town residents in bondage . the municipal court system used excessive court fines and fees to ensure that citizens arrested for even minor infractions would be charged thousands of dollars or face jail time . court costs and fees constituted the second-largest sources of revenue for the town . rather than a force for public safety , the ferguson police department became , according to attorney general eric holder , `` a collection agency '' -- one that preyed disproportionately on the town 's african-american residents . the evidence of ugly and explicit racial discrimination was devastating . it included blatantly racist emails traded among officers , and evidence that african-americans were victims in all of the police canine bite incidents recorded by the department . but just a few weeks before the release of the report , the ferguson police chief declared there were `` no racial issues '' in his department . ferguson 's ugly , racist emails released . the recommendations in the report , ranging from new training and supervision of police officers , addressing racially discriminatory conduct to structural revisions in the court system , will , if implemented , remake the law enforcement system in the town . -lrb- a grand jury that investigated the shooting of brown by officer darren wilson chose not to file charges against him and the justice department also did n't find reason to prosecute . -rrb- . without question , change is coming to the town 's government . town manager john shaw , ferguson 's most powerful official and , until the doj 's blistering report , the one who inexplicably managed to elude public scrutiny , resigned weeks ago and has been replaced by the city 's deputy manager . three sitting city council members chose not to run for office again and , on tuesday , citizens elected two black candidates to the city council , changing its racial composition : five of six members and the mayor were white . now the council will be 50 % black . ferguson 's hapless police chief thomas jackson also finally resigned after holding on through a months-long display of astonishing incompetence . the department first drew the attention of the nation for its display of military weaponry and tear gas in response to civilian protests . the appointment of a commander from the state highway patrol was deemed necessary to begin quelling the unrest and to build community trust in the early days of the protest . jackson 's departure sent an important signal to the population of a town preyed upon by officers under his command . and so we can be certain that along with the new makeup of the city council , there will be a new police chief in ferguson . but does that mean that fundamental change will come to ferguson ? not necessarily . not unless protest and activism during this critical period turns to influence the vitally important opportunities that lie ahead in the coming weeks . the department of justice 's full-on negotiations with the leadership in ferguson will determine the shape of the new ferguson police department . indeed , the doj report alludes to the possibility of disbanding the department in favor of a regional policing integration with st. louis county . many local activists have suggested just such a solution , but given ongoing problems with policing in the county -- including the role of county forces in some of the most controversial clashes with activists in ferguson last fall -- community representatives will have to fight hard to ensure that the doj can fold st. louis county police into its monitoring and reform process . equally important were the april 7 general elections . turnout in municipal elections has been notoriously low in ferguson , with white voters nearly three times more likely to turn out than african-americans . but local groups had engaged in vigorous voter registration and get-out-the-vote campaigns . . the mayor has two years left to his term and has defiantly insisted that he will not resign -lrb- although a petition for his recall has been circulating -rrb- . that means that he will be a lead voice in negotiating with the doj to remake the police department . has he committed to a clear set of principles that will guide his participation in those talks ? community activists and residents must ensure that mayor james knowles plans to represent their vision of new ferguson police department . but there is an opportunity to begin thinking about even more ambitious structural change in ferguson and throughout st. louis county . ferguson 's governing structure , with a strong city manager and a weak council and mayor , mirrors that of thousands of other suburbs in the united states . that form of governance might have been precisely what thriving , middle class white suburbanites wanted when they fled racial integration in cities like st. louis . but working class suburbs like ferguson with a majority black population in which the needs of the population in the areas of education and economic opportunity more closely hews to the needs of urban residents , may need a more robust form of governance . in any case , a system in which the elected officials have minimal power , but non-elected leaders , like the town manager and the chief of police , have inordinate power , is a recipe for the kind of unaccountable , non-representative government that controlled ferguson 's residents . yet this precise form of government is in wide use across the country . likewise , missouri , like the vast majority of states , holds municipal elections in non-presidential election years , guaranteeing a significantly lower voter turnout -- although only a few states hold the primary and general election in march and april as missouri law requires ferguson to do . it 's not that ferguson is so different than towns across america . it 's precisely because ferguson holds up a mirror to flaws in our democratic system of government in towns across this country that the stakes are so high . ferguson residents now have the opportunity to begin a movement for change in the other 89 jurisdictions in st. louis county plagued by similar governance flaws , including those towns led by african-americans . and ferguson 's example should provoke self-examination in working class suburbs across the country , where the power and effectiveness of weak elected local government is inadequate to meet the needs of the population . change is coming to ferguson . but the scope and breadth of that change will depend upon the ambition and discipline of activists and residents , whose passion and tenacity have already transformed the trajectory of leadership in a typical american town .\\x8f\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc41-lrb- cnn -rrb- there was a larger message in the article about a purported gang rape that rolling stone retracted on sunday night -- a part of the story that was never disputed : the university of virginia is under continuing investigation over how it handles sexual assault on campus . the school has never expelled a single student for sexual assault -- even when the student admitted to it . the virginia attorney general asked the law firm of o'melveny & myers to take a look at how the university historically handled allegations of sexual assault by its students . that includes how uva officials handled the allegations in the discredited rolling stone article by a student the magazine called `` jackie , '' especially since the school knew about the allegations for more than a year before the article came out . the alleged gang rape at a fraternity house was in 2012 , and jackie told the university about it the next spring . she started telling her story very publicly , including at a `` take back the night '' rally . but charlottesville police did n't hear about it until after a separate incident in the spring of 2014 , in which jackie claimed someone threw a bottle that hit her in the face . when a university dean arranged for her to talk to police about that alleged assault , she also told the story of the alleged 2012 incident . in both cases , police said jackie refused to cooperate and so they could not pursue the case . but more women came forward to talk about their experiences -- women whose stories were not as dramatic or horrific as jackie 's . rolling stone 's story opened up a conversation about the topic , and then women began coming forward to talk about a culture on campus that was not sensitive to victims . many women told cnn about a euphemism for the word rape used by other students on campus . they 'd call it a `` bad experience . '' others told cnn that there were fraternities with reputations for being `` rapey '' and for using date-rape drugs . that some judged who could come in based on the sluttiness of a woman 's outfit . and if a woman did report her rape , some women complained that the internal process did n't seem worth it if their abuser would n't be kicked out of school . rolling stone had a line in its original story : `` uva 's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998 , 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams . and yet paradoxically , not a single student at uva has ever been expelled for sexual assault . '' after the article published , uva admitted this and instituted a zero-tolerance policy on sexual assault going forward -- although that policy was never defined , so it 's unclear what it means . when the story was deleted from rolling stone 's website , that was lost . `` you lose a lot of other people 's voices who were in that article , '' said sarah roderick , a survivor and uva student , `` and a lot of good things that could have come about . fixing problems with administration here and on our campus '' -- and , she added , across the nationo . along with the o'melveny & myers investigation , there 's also an open title ix investigation into uva by the u.s. department of education as a result of a civil suit . the attorney who filed the suit , james marsh , told cnn that uva medical staff lost or destroyed evidence from the alleged sexual assault victim he 's representing , making it impossible for her to move forward and get justice . when the columbia journalism school 's 12,000-plus-word critique is summed up , it really boils down to this : the mistake could have been avoided if the writer , sabrina rubin erdely , had picked up the phone and made just a few more phone calls to the friends of jackie who she claimed were with her that night . they 'd later tell other media outlets , including cnn , that they remembered a very different story . rolling stone says their account would have been a red flag . and all three say they would have talked if they 'd been called . ryan duffin , one of the trio , said he felt deceived by jackie , but he also pointed out that erdely 's mistake in fact-checking was about one single incident , and the fallout has caused a much bigger issue to be lost . `` had she gotten in direct contact with us , it probably would n't have been printed , at least in that way , '' he said . `` a lot of the article was still based in truth , but the focal point would have been different . '' it might have been less dramatic , but it would have probably focused on some of the other uva students who shared much more common stories of acquaintance rape on campus . `` i think my problem with it was that this reporter wanted to sensationalize an experience that 's not very common , '' roderick said . '' ... and i wonder if it would have been different if -lrb- it dealt -rrb- with someone with a less horrific story -- something that happens to more people . i think this discredits what a lot of survivors go through . something this physically horrific is not what everyone goes through . now it 's like , ` if i was n't assaulted by more than one man then my story is not as worthy of attention . ' it 's frustrating that this is how rape is portrayed on college campuses because this is not the norm . '' before the report came out , abraham axler , the student body president , said that some good had come from the article because it forced uva to institute new policies and to open up a conversation on a topic that needed to be discussed nationwide . but some survivors and advocates are afraid the retraction set back their progress . `` i do feel like there 's a possibility people will be afraid to come forward . if you come forward and share your story , if you do n't have the date right , every detail down , you 'll think , ` i 'm going to be accused of being a liar . it 's easier for me to keep it to myself , ' '' roderick said . `` there are very serious and unresolved questions about the university 's performance , '' said steve coll , dean of the columbia school of journalism . `` rolling stone teed that subject up . i would n't say that everything about rolling stone 's treatment of that subject was perfect , but it certainly does n't fall under the same category as their reporting about jackie 's narrative .

'' he is , of course , right . as greg norman knows only too well , anything can happen on the final day . but that kind of crescendo also depends on spieth experiencing a greg norman-style meltdown . spieth 's double bogey on the 17th and wobble on the 18th will give the chasing pack some hope . yet , for all the movement of mickelson , woods , rose and mcilroy , they made just a one shot dent into spieth 's second round lead . he will begin sunday four shots ahead .h\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the revelations of the underground city , which extends for miles in some directions , have come to light recently only because of a series of events , gusky said . the underground city actually dates back centuries but was sealed up in the 18th century . it was rediscovered in the late 19th century . during world war i , soldiers would take refuge in the carved-out rooms and pathways . the front was sometimes mere miles away ; the battle of the somme , one of the bloodiest in world history , was fought nearby in 1916 . the land was privately owned for many years and generally off-limits to outsiders , said gusky , but it changed hands in 2013 . the rights to operate it were purchased by a consortium of villages that wanted to promote awareness of the area 's history , he said . researching the city is a painstaking task . for one thing , it 's dark , so observers generally have n't realized what 's in there until they 've gone exploring . moreover , the maze-like extensiveness of the site has made discovery a slow process . `` they go on and on and on . they 're so elaborate in some places , there are maps carved into stone so the soldiers would n't get lost , '' he said . the graffiti looks like it was written yesterday , he added . gusky has noted 1,821 names . about 40 % are australian , with most of the others identified as british . fifty-five are americans , and 662 have yet to be traced . for gusky , the graffiti provides a human connection with men who lived a century ago . in many cases , they just wanted to be remembered , he said . `` someone could be in this place one day and the next fighting at the front , '' he said . leach , `` merely a private , '' was killed a month later in battle , gusky observed . `` it could very well have been the last time he recorded his name as a living , breathing human being , '' he said . 7 things you did n't know about the man who started wwi .\\xb3\\x1c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x837durham , north carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- president obama 's nomination of loretta lynch to become the country 's first african-american woman attorney general is a historic pick . her confirmation , however , is now taking on new historical relevance as her wait for a confirmation vote by the full senate drags into its sixth month . the period between the senate judiciary committee 's vote to confirm and the full senate vote -- which in lynch 's case has not been scheduled -- has lasted longer for her than for any attorney general nominee in recent history . by the time the senate returns from easter recess on monday , it 'll have been longer than the eight previous nominees for the job -- combined . lynch , currently the u.s. attorney for the eastern district of new york , cleared the committee february 26 by a vote of 12-8 , with republican sens. orrin hatch of utah , lindsey graham of south carolina and jeff flake of arizona joining democrats in sending the nomination to the full senate . obama nominated lynch to replace attorney general eric holder on november 8 , after holder had announced plans to leave the post weeks earlier . hundreds of miles from washington , longtime residents of durham , north carolina , were beaming with pride . lynch 's family moved to the city when she was a child . her parents , married for 60 years , still live there . they watched the announcement on television . `` that was encouraging but i knew then that we had a fight on our hands , '' said lynch 's father , the rev. lorenzo lynch . `` i 've been in politics most of my life . i know that nothing is certain , and i know that nothing is easy . '' lorenzo lynch , 82 , is a retired baptist preacher and was active in the civil rights movement of the 1960s . he ran , unsuccessfully , for mayor of durham in 1973 . for the next round of his daughter 's `` fight , '' he traveled to washington in late january to attend his daughter 's confirmation hearing before the judiciary committee . `` i heard a lot at that hearing that i 've heard since childhood . that is the presupposition of the mindset , '' lorenzo lynch said . `` the dual system or the dual treatment . '' when asked to provide specific examples , lorenzo lynch deferred to the state branch of the naacp and e. lavonia allison , a durham activist who has known loretta lynch since the family moved to durham . `` i do n't want to think about the epidermis , but some people are thinking that way , '' allison said , suggesting that lynch 's confirmation vote has been delayed because lynch is african-american . `` when it has taken so long , when it has been so different from any other person who has been nominated ... how else can we interpret that it is so different ? '' allison said . in march , rep. g.k. butterfield , d-north carolina , chairman of the congressional black caucus , said , `` i think race certainly can be considered as a major factor in the reason for this delay , but it 's also the irrationality of the new republicans . '' sen. dick durbin , d-illinois , evoked imagery of the segregated south in criticism of republicans , saying lynch had been `` asked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the senate calendar . '' durbin was harshly criticized by arizona 's sen. john mccain . `` i deeply regret that the senator from illinois chose to come here yesterday and question the integrity and motivation , mine and my republican colleagues , '' mccain said on the senate floor . `` it was offensive and unnecessary , and i think he owes this body , ms. lynch and all americans an apology , '' mccain added . `` i thought he should be commended , '' lorenzo lynch said . `` i think that 's a poetic description of what has happened and poetry , like most language , is limited but it does have wings ... to carry a point . '' giuliani pushes for lynch confirmation . senate republicans adamantly deny the delay in scheduling a vote on lynch 's nomination is because she is african-american . many point out that lynch , if confirmed , will be replacing the country 's first african-american attorney general who was confirmed by an overwhelming margin . instead , republicans and democrats say the delay is part of an ongoing partisan battle . for some , it 's part of a fight over a human trafficking bill that has stalled in the senate . for others , the delay is retaliation for president obama 's 2014 executive actions on immigration . on the eve of holder 's announcement of his plans to leave the department of justice , the political number crunchers at fivethirtyeight.com predicted that whoever the president nominated would `` likely face at least a moderately tough confirmation hearing in the senate . '' some of lynch 's supporters across north carolina have organized to convince the state 's two republican senators to support lynch 's confirmation . in march , several dozen north carolina women , led by the naacp , traveled to washington to meet with their senators , richard burr and thom tillis . reportedly , the meeting lasted nearly an hour and was very cordial . at a news conference at the washington press club , the group blasted the senators for opposing the nomination . `` senator burr and senator tillis , it is time for you to act like you have some sense . it 's past time . you have embarrassed the state of north carolina , '' allison said after the meeting . for their part , burr and tillis released a statement after the meeting : `` while we remain concerned with ms. lynch 's stated desire to lead the department of justice in the same manner as eric holder and will not be supporting her nomination , we are grateful that the group came to washington to talk about this issue and exchange ideas . weeks later , the naacp organized protests outside the senators ' offices in raleigh , charlotte and wilmington . `` i think there is a much deeper analysis , '' said north carolina naacp branch president rev. william barber ii . `` i believe if she had been clarence thomas , she would have been confirmed . '' `` because of her courage , her character and her commitment to the law and to the enforcement of the laws of this land , particularly the 14th and 15th amendments to the constitution , and because her consciousness was shaped in the crucible of the civil rights movement -- that is what they fear , '' barber said . obama turns up the heat on loretta lynch confirmation ` limbo ' lorenzo lynch says he carried his daughter to several civil rights marches on his shoulders . he admits that he did not think that much of the recent progress of african-americans was possible when he was fighting for equal rights . now , his small living room is filled with stacks of loosely organized newspaper stories about his daughter 's nomination and photos of his visit to the white house . lynch admits that he 's never told his only daughter that he 's proud of her , although he 's sure she knows it . he plans to change that , soon , regardless of the outcome of her pending nomination .\\xbe\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x9c)-lrb- cnn -rrb- are we alone in the cosmos ? or might there be intelligent life elsewhere ? last week , nasa scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two . this year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun , 51 pegasi . since then , ground-based surveys and nasa 's kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed `` exoplanets , '' and thousands more candidates await confirmation . many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system . some have large planets like jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than mercury , the innermost planet in our solar system . but smaller rocky planets like earth , though harder to find , appear to be even more abundant . life on earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed . that suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life . life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water . astronomers define the `` habitable zone '' around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet 's surface . any closer to the star , the water will boil into vapor ; any farther and the water freezes into ice . extrapolating from discoveries to date , astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion earth-like , habitable-zone planets in our milky way galaxy alone . of course , there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals , which appeared about 200 million years ago . and then the humans , who have existed for only 200,000 years . intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on earth . so while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen , the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did , with ears and spoken language , or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny . and life that can use radio waves has existed on earth for only 0.000002 % of the planet 's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion . if the half dozen or so rocky , earth-like exoplanets now known are similar , the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as , well , winning your state lottery with one ticket . of course , if there are 40 billion earth-like planets out there , the odds improve quite a bit . if they all have histories like the earth 's , there might be 1,000 planets in the milky way that could support communicative beings . but before you start composing your first letter to an alien , think about this : the chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule . another planet 's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago , or it might happen a billion years in the future . a lot depends on how long communication capabilities last . civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet . so the duration of the communication age on a planet could be short . not to mention : the average light-travel-time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years , so unless humans evolve to be ageless , we 're not exchanging ims with aliens anytime soon . if advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more , the chances of communicating with them are not negligible . but in that case , they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are -lrb- since they developed the capability far earlier than we did -rrb- -- so if they wanted us to know they exist , would n't they simply tell us ? the seti project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than 30 years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence . probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive . astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules , the building blocks of life , in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy . possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen-rich atmosphere , such as that created by the first bacteria on earth , or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide . nasa 's james webb space telescope , to be launched in 2018 , will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky , habitable exoplanets . nasa 's rovers have shown that mars was once much more habitable . it had fresh-water lakes and streams of water running along its surface . some water still remains , and there may yet be life discovered on mars . new missions plan to look at europa and ganymede , moons of jupiter that have liquid water below their icy surfaces . life elsewhere in the universe , and even elsewhere in our own milky way galaxy , is practically inevitable . signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes . but the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years .\\x81\\x1e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfb9london -lrb- cnn -rrb- it was n't messrs clooney , pitt and their nine accomplices who sailed down an elevator shaft and cracked open dozens of safety deposit boxes at a london vault during the easter weekend . but last weekend 's raid in the heart of the city 's jewelry district feels like it has been taken from a movie like `` ocean 11 '' given its daring and planning . such robberies are rare : the gang did n't follow the current criminal trend of manipulating digits in cyber space but instead went back to basics and committed their burglary in a way not seen in london for more than 40 years . in september 1971 , the staff of a bank in baker street , central london , arrived at work to find that thieves had dug a 40-yard tunnel from a shop they had rented , hauled in a thermic lance and explosives and opened the strong room . the gang got away with a haul worth around # 30 million -lrb- the incident later formed the basis of the movie `` the bank job . '' -rrb- . but how are such heists organized ? roy ramm , a former commander of specialist operations at london 's scotland yard for 27 years , explains . in the uk burglaries and robberies are often committed by working-class people , people who would otherwise have blue collar jobs . in more than 25 years as a scotland yard detective , i never met a raffles - or a thomas crown-style criminal from a middle-class background who had then turned to the hard side of crime . sophisticated heists like the hatton garden raid are generally not a natural progression for burglars who began with smaller domestic break-ins . many neighborhood criminals commit burglaries to feed drugs habits and acquire long strings of convictions that mean they are always on the police radar . occasionally , they steal things they ca n't sell and end up dumping valuable paintings or antiques when they are not able to sell them on quickly . more specialist criminals -- those , for example , who target museums or country houses -- will be very specific and steal only what they know they can quickly convert to untraceable cash . many of those who commit the bigger crimes or run major criminal enterprises combine high iqs with a kind of raw street intelligence . one of their skills is the ability to recognize a criminal opportunity when it presents itself , possibly from a source of inside information . probably the biggest difference between any heist you 'll see in a movie and its real-life equivalent is the motive . i 've never encountered any criminal who committed a high value crime just for the challenge or to prove that it could be done . the only reason has been for the money , often to support a certain lifestyle and to fund other criminal enterprises . inside information is one way of identifying a criminal opportunity , using people who are able to provide that crucial detail or who will participate in some small way to facilitate the crime . the brinks mat robbery in 1983 -- a case which i was involved in at the time -- saw a criminal gang escape with gold bullion worth more than # 28 million -lrb- around # 88 million -- or $ 130million -- adjusting for inflation -rrb- from a warehouse at london 's heathrow airport . the knightsbridge safety deposit robbery of 1987 saw a gang make off with tens of millions of pounds in cash and valuables from an upscale london neighbourhood -lrb- the true amount will never be known -rrb- . both were made possible by inside information : it 's an angle that london detectives investigating last weekend 's heist will be looking at very closely . the planning behind the hatton garden raid will have been meticulous . the target will have been observed , perhaps for months , and the thieves will have decided on the right time to commit the crime . a long weekend or a public holiday are occasions when more time may be available , also perhaps when regular staff are away . sometimes the mastermind behind the raid will need a larger team of criminals to do a specific job . usually they will already be known directly to each other , perhaps because they worked on other jobs together . possibly a specialist can be brought in by another team member -- but they have to be able to trust each other and trust comes from understanding , so gangs in the uk tend to come from the same social and ethnic group , maybe even limited to one relatively small geographic area . even though there is more diversity in society , it would be unusual to find a broad ethnic or social mix in the team put together for a major crime . vehicles will have been obtained , stolen or purchased for cash and their identities cloned or changed . equipment will have been sourced . everything will have been cleaned , cleaned and cleaned again to remove forensic traces . they will plan routes that avoid cctv and timings that attract the least attention . they will have untraceable disposable phones and an outside team to warn the inside men of any problems . they will have planned their getaway , their clean-up and how and when they are going to dispose of anything that might link them to the crime scene -- and of course how they are going to sell on the proceeds of their crime . what criminals steal does n't vary that much . cash is probably first choice , followed by anything that can quickly and easily be converted to cash , like gold , jewellery and watches . the conversion of stolen goods to cash is risky and expensive : the brinks mat bullion that was traced was because it had been clumsily smelted and then sold on . fine paintings and rare antiques are less desirable for experienced criminals -- unless they are stealing to order -- because they are so identifiable and because the black market is so much smaller . a painting may sell at an international auction for millions of dollars but it will only fetch a fraction of its true value from a dishonest collector . london detectives investigating the hatton garden heist will be looking very closely at the possibility of inside involvement . but police enquiries wo n't stop there . they will look at every aspect of how the target business operates , then try to think like criminals to identify the weaknesses in physical and operational security that the gang may have been informed about or else spotted and then exploited . the forensic assault on the crime scene will be immense . in recent years forensic science has made major advances in identifying trace evidence and investigators will look for any scrap of evidence that might yield the dna of a criminal . cctv footage from street cameras and from inside private premises will be analyzed and vehicle movements logged and cross-checked . rewards for information will be offered . witnesses will interviewed . in the police 's criminal intelligence branch , the movements of known criminals will be analyzed and the networks of sources -- informers -- will be tasked to report what they hear . the details of any identifiable goods which have been stolen will be circulated to known markets , both in the uk and internationally . the detectives investigating these major crimes in the uk see them as an exciting challenge to their professionalism . they do n't admire the criminals but they have less contempt for a gang that builds a sophisticated plan and causes no personal harm to anyone than say for a violent robber . but the investigation will still be relentless .\\x85\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b'\\xdf\"-lrb- cnn -rrb- recently , a new york judge issued an opinion authorizing service of divorce papers on a husband completely via facebook . what exactly is `` service of process \\'\\' ? serving people with legal papers is an industry and its own body of law premised on one guiding principle : if you are going to sue someone , you should at least let them know about it . sounds simple , right ? in theory it is . in practice , it turns out people do n\\'t like being sued . it also turns out that , to many defendants , procrastination of a lawsuit is a viable defense . just as you may avoid bad news in life , defendants tend to avoid process servers . once a defendant has been served , that means the judicial proceedings begin . unfortunately , that means defendants have an incentive to go `` off the grid \\'\\' . although every state is different , the law of service of process has evolved this way : the ideal and fairest way to notify a person of a lawsuit is to have another human hand the papers to the defendant in person , and have some proof that the person was the defendant . in-person service is not always possible , for obvious reasons . so , the law had to develop methods of alternate service , but carefully balance a defendant \\'s right to have notice of a lawsuit , against a diligent plaintiff \\'s access to court if a defendant is avoiding the inevitable . as reliable as the u.s. mail is , regular mail is not a reliable form of serving papers . not because the postmen ca n\\'t be trusted ; they can . neither snow , nor rain , nor heat , nor gloom of night , will keep them from delivering those papers . instead , it \\'s defendants -- no wait , all of humanity -- that ca n\\'t be trusted . every one of us has ignored mail or even pretended we did n\\'t get it . defendants are no different . one form of alternate service is `` nail and mail \\'\\' service . this means that you take a hammer and nail , and nail the papers to the defendant \\'s front door . the problem with that is that many defendants are nomadic by nature . just because you find a house that a defendant stayed at , does n\\'t mean he \\'ll be back there anytime soon . another , even odder form of `` service \\'\\' is service by publication . this is an almost laughable legal fiction . if you ca n\\'t find a defendant , a judge might let you serve by publication . that means that a plaintiff can take out an ad in five point font for a week in an obscure publication , on the off chance you are reading the classified ads of the secaucus law journal looking for lawsuits against you . as laughable as serving someone by tweeting it sounds , it \\'s at least more rational than this antiquated method . at first blush , the idea of service by facebook seems to offend traditional notions of ensuring notification of a defendant of a case against him . when it comes to serving papers , however , `` traditional \\'\\' does n\\'t necessarily mean `` good . \\'\\' service by publication or nailing paper to the door of an empty apartment is hardly reliable ; it \\'s just service of last resort . for those people who are concerned that being served papers will become a facebook announcement in a news feed , along with the photos of dinner or kittens , to be `` liked \\'\\' by all your gawking `` friends , \\'\\' we \\'re not quite there ... yet . while the older forms of alternate service were public , most electronic service takes the form of email . where email is n\\'t available , it is facebook private messaging , which should be as private as email . that \\'s the form of service authorized by the court here . so for now , we \\'re not quite putting lawsuits on instagram ... but i would n\\'t rule it out in the future . online service may be a new frontier , but it \\'s not unheard of . most of us exist more online now than we `` live \\'\\' in a particular condo , or mom \\'s basement . virtually everyone has a phone or access to the internet . not everyone has a lease or a mortgage . plus , online service has the added benefit of tracking . believe me , somewhere , some computer has already logged the fact that you read this article , how long you read it , and even how far down you scrolled before you got bored and bailed on the article -lrb- thanks for still being here , by the way -rrb- . in a way , maybe online service is long overdue . you can outrun a process server for a while , but sooner or later , all of us have to go back online -- and no human can outrun an email .\\xfc\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

'' wang told cnn that prosecutors had to decide whether to pursue the charges within seven days of the submission -- by monday . `` we hope that the prosecutors will not approve a formal arrest warrant , following the laws and standing up to pressure , '' he said . `` but nobody knows what to expect till monday ; we can do nothing but wait . '' the five were initially held on suspicion of `` picking quarrels and provoking trouble . '' wang said he did n't know why the charge against the women changed . `` neither should constitute a crime , '' he said . campaign group amnesty international said the new charge was less serious but still carried a maximum jail term of five years . `` the women were doing nothing wrong , nothing illegal . they were simply calling for an end to sexual harassment , '' william nee , china researcher at amnesty international told cnn . `` everything they were doing was in line with china 's own laws and policies . '' wang said that wei had been subject to lengthy cross examinations during her detention but was well the last time they met on march 31 . two of the women are said to be in poor health . he added that the charges relate both to the activities the women planned for international women 's day and earlier campaigns against domestic violence and for more public toilets for women . the five -- who are members of china 's women 's rights action group -- had planned to hand out stickers printed with slogans saying `` stop sexual harassment , let us stay safe '' and `` go police , go arrest those who committed sexual harassment ! '' on women 's day . the detention of wei , along with wu rongrong , li tingting , wang man and zheng churan has drawn harsh criticism from the international community . protests have taken place in several cities , including hong kong , that urge chinese officials to `` free the five . '' a social media campaign also uses the phrase as a hashtag . on monday , hillary clinton , former u.s. secretary of state , tweeted that the activists ' detention was `` inexcusable . '' her comment drew a rebuke from chinese authorities , who said public figures should respect china 's sovereignty and independence . maya wang , china researcher at human rights watch , said the activists were best known for their `` performance art '' style protests -- occupying public toilets to highlight long lines at women 's restrooms , donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence and shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women . `` these activists epitomize the spirit of the times . they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , '' wang said . as china prepares to mark the anniversary of landmark un fourth world conference on women in september , it will be hard for authorities to justify detaining the activists , she added .6\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

' so they are hard negotiators as they always have been . '' the forum could provide the opportunity to push forward an agreement to re-establish formal relations and re-open embassies after nearly four months of negotiations . while president barack obama is not scheduled to meet cuban leader raul castro , u.s. officials said there will be opportunities for `` interaction '' between the two leaders . the first time the two heads of state met was in 2013 at nelson mandela 's funeral . their brief handshake captured the world 's attention and lit up social media . few people then knew that the two countries were secretly involved in negotiations to thaw five decades of deadlocked cold war-era relations . obama had said he had hoped a u.s. embassy would reopen in havana before the summit , but cuban officials have said they can not imagine a full restoration of diplomatic ties until cuba is removed from the u.s. state department list of countries that support terrorism . `` it would be difficult to explain that diplomatic relations have been resumed while cuba has been unjustly listed as a state sponsor of international terrorism , '' said josefina vidal , the general director of u.s. affairs at the cuban foreign ministry and lead negotiator in the talks . cuba was added to the list in 1982 , which includes syria , iran and sudan . the designation carries financial sanctions which cuban officials say further damages their already ailing economy . the state department has sent a recommendation to the white house that cuba be removed , paving the way for the white house to announce its intent to de-list cuba as early as this week , two administration officials told cnn . removal from the list `` does not relate to whether or not we agree with everything a country does or whether we agree with its political system , or its foreign policy , '' deputy national security adviser ben rhodes said on a conference call with reporters tuesday . `` it 's a very practical review as to whether or not a government is sponsoring terrorism . '' rhodes also dialed backed rhetoric on venezuela , saying the country did not pose a national security threat to the united states , despite a recent declaration to that effect . the designation was meant to allow officials to target seven allegedly corrupt venezuelan officials , but it ignited a firestorm , particularly in cuba , which has close ties to venezuela . deceased venezuelan president hugo chavez was a friend and admirer of former cuban leader fidel castro . chavez 's successor nicolas maduro continues to send cuba tens of thousands of barrels of oil each day , despite his country 's own economic turmoil . in exchange , cuba sends doctors , military advisers and sports trainers to venezuela . in cuba 's state-run media , criticism of u.s. policy towards venezuela has overshadowed the improvement in u.s.-cuba relations . in march , fidel castro published a letter criticizing the u.s. ' `` brutal plans towards '' venezuela and the cuban government promised `` unconditional aid '' to help defend against american threats . its remains to be seen how much cuba will risk its warming relations with the united states to back up ally venezuela . but apparently there is little doubt among the cuban people on what their government should do . a poll of 1,200 cubans released on wednesday found that 97 % of the people surveyed by miami-based polling firm bendixen & amandi on behalf of the washington post and univision noticias/fusion supported improved u.s.-cuban relations .\\xb1\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xda\\x19-lrb- cnn -rrb- getting caught napping on the job is never good . getting caught napping on the job in the cargo hold of a plane takes it to a whole different level . alaska airlines flight 448 was just barely on its way to los angeles from seattle-tacoma international airport on monday afternoon when the pilot reported hearing unusual banging from the cargo hold . `` there could be a person in there so we 're going to come back around , '' he told air traffic control . the banging in the cargo hold did come from a person and he turned out to be a ramp agent from menzies aviation , a contractor for alaska airlines that handles loading the luggage , the airline said . the man told authorities he had fallen asleep . it appears he was never in any danger . the cargo hold is pressurized and temperature controlled , the airline said . the plane was also only in the air for 14 minutes . the passengers knew something was n't right , almost as soon as the plane took off . `` all of a sudden we heard all this pounding underneath the plane and we thought there was something wrong with the landing gear , '' robert higgins told cnn affiliate kabc . the pounding grew louder . `` at that point , we started hearing yelling , screams for help , very , very faint , '' jamie davis said . `` that 's when we notified the flight attendant that there was somebody underneath us . '' as the banging continued , a federal air marshal sprang into action . `` at some point , the marshal kind of made himself known , '' said troi ge . `` he started banging back , and he yelled really loud and said , ` we 're getting ready to land , hold on to something . ' '' the emergency landing spooked the folks aboard flight 448 . affiliate komo spoke to marty collins , another one of the passengers . `` we just took off for l.a. regular and then ... about five minutes into the flight the captain came on and said we were going back and we 'd land within five to seven minutes , and we did , '' collins said . `` when we landed was when all the trucks and the police and the fire trucks surrounded the plane . '' `` i think it 's scary and really unsafe , too , '' chelsie nieto told affiliate kcpq . `` because what if it 's someone who could have been a terrorist ? '' the ramp agent appeared to be in ok after the ordeal . he was taken to an area hospital as a precaution , the airline said . he passed a drug test and was discharged . the employee started work at 5 a.m. and his shift was scheduled to end at 2:30 p.m. , just before the flight departed . `` during a pre-departure huddle , the team lead noticed the employee was missing . the team lead called into the cargo hold for the employee and called and texted the employee 's cell phone , but did not receive an answer . his co-workers believed he finished his shift and went home , '' the airline 's blog said . alaska airlines said it 's investigating . the man had been on a four-person team loading baggage onto the flight . all ramp employees have security badges , and undergo full criminal background checks before being hired , according to the airline . after the delay , the flight with 170 passengers and six crew members on board made it to los angeles early monday evening . cnn 's greg morrison contributed to this report .\\xb5\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x85\\x19-lrb- cnn -rrb- a hooded angel with black wings appeared on tuesday near the spot where walter scott was shot and killed by a police officer in north charleston , south carolina , on saturday . since then , it 's been taken up as an icon of the black lives matter movement . when protesters held the winged figure at a wednesday morning rally outside north charleston 's city hall , the artwork was widely photographed . creator phillip hyman grew up in the neighborhood where scott , an unarmed black man , was shot in the back several times by a white police officer on saturday . hyman now lives in another part of the city and could n't stop thinking about it . he woke up about 3 a.m. a couple of days after scott was killed and began searching for materials . `` art is really about that moment . i just could n't take it any longer , '' he said . hyman dug into the trash and found a piece of wood that was the perfect size . then he picked up a can of black house paint and started making the reclaimed wood into a work of art . the 56-year-old said he crafted the artwork as a way of mourning with the family . `` that 's who all this should really be about , not about the propaganda and making it your own story , '' said hyman , who talks quickly and passionately about his subject material . `` shooting him in the back and just the indignity of it all . '' the figure , painted black in mourning for the family , has wings because it 's going to heaven , hyman said . the man depicted in hyman 's piece is dressed in a hooded sweatsuit , though that 's not what scott was wearing when he was killed . hyman said he prefers not to say too much about who the black angel figure is . people can look at the art and make their own interpretations , he said . `` it 's a statement of where we are in america today . it 's relevant in charleston , ferguson , florida , anywhere now . '' after hyman put the piece up on tuesday near where scott was killed , he got a call from a local protester with the black lives matter movement , which has staged protests around the country in the wake of high-profile deaths at the hands of police . the group asked for permission to use his artwork in its demonstrations at the north charleston city hall . hyman was happy to oblige . each day , the protesters call hyman and he either carries the angel-winged artwork to the protest , or the protesters come over to his home to pick it up . `` it 's taken a life of its own , so i 'm letting it do what it 's supposed to do now , '' he said . freelance photographer joel woodhall spotted the artwork and wondered where it came from . woodhall , who lives in nearby charleston , said the artwork made him feel sorrow for a life ended too soon . `` it was very emotionally moving . it 's beautiful , '' he told cnn . this is n't the first time hyman has used artwork to effect change : he restored a local theater to its former glory . he commemorated martin luther king jr. 's birthday by painting a mural in a bad neighborhood that needed light . hyman 's wife , kay , says her husband always paints from the heart . `` to see this recognized , he just goes into tears because it 's very special to him .

'' one year later , a few things have changed . each of the missing girls has had a birthday in captivity . each is now a year older . nigeria 's current president , goodluck jonathan , was defeated in his campaign for re-election , in part , it is thought , because he failed to effectively combat boko haram . buhari , the incoming president , has pledged an aggressive effort to wipe out the group . but much remains unchanged , as well . boko haram still controls swathes of northeastern nigeria . according to unicef , 800,000 children have been forced to flee their homes because of the conflict between the nigerian military , civilian self-defense groups , and boko haram . amnesty international says women and children continue to be abducted . and it says boko haram continues to kill in large numbers . beyond that , more than 200 schoolgirls who had gathered one year ago to take their science exam are still missing . their families are still bereft . and tuesday on twitter , a hashtag was still trending : #bringbackourgirls .\\xee\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' supporters of the measure described it as a groundbreaking step , while opponents warned it was dangerous and among the most restrictive abortion laws in the country . the law does not spell out a specific time frame that limits when an abortion can occur , but it bans the dilation and evacuation abortion procedure commonly used during the second trimester of pregnancy . the law allows for the procedure if `` necessary to protect the life or health of the mother , '' according to a statement on brownback 's website . on twitter , brownback , a republican , said he was proud to sign a law `` protecting life at its most vulnerable stage .

'' officials at philadelphia 's school of the future , which the man attends , became concerned when he did n't show up for classes last week and tried to contact his mother but eventually reached an aunt , philadelphia police said . `` the aunt was in contact via text message with nyia throughout the week and when she expressed her concerns about the complainant , nyia replied , ` we 're ok , ' which the aunt believed meant that the victim was with nyia in maryland , '' according to a police news release . when police tracked down the mother , she told them her son was with her , walker said . `` she indicated to both family members and the police officers that the child was with her down with her boyfriend in maryland , '' he said . the boyfriend was not aware of what happened , walker told cnn affiliate kyw-tv . when she arrives in philadelphia , the mother will stand charged with aggravated assault , simple assault , recklessly endangering another person and related offenses , a philadelphia police spokeswoman said . walker told reporters she bore `` clear criminal liability in this case . '' there was no reason for the man to suffer , walker told philly.com , because the mother had sisters willing to take care of him . two of his aunts , who have tried to obtain guardianship of him , were staying with him at the hospital , police told the website . parler 's sister told police that parler has another child , a 16-year-old . the mother 's arrest was only the beginning of the investigation , walker told reporters . authorities are interested in learning more about `` how this kid was cared for , and what actions were taken and providing of services by different agencies . '' cnn 's chuck johnston and carma hassan contributed to this report .\\xd3\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb7#-lrb- cnn -rrb- what would you do if a complete stranger asked you for $ 100 , or offered you an apple in a parking lot without explanation ? these are only two of the 100 challenges chinese-born , american-based jia jiang put himself up to when he decided to blog about `` 100 days of rejection '' , a project he launched after he quit his comfortable six-figure job to follow his dreams of being an entrepreneur at the age of 30 , just weeks before his first child was born . after his tech start-up was declined investment , jiang decided to confront his fear of rejection head-on . this led to his writing his book called rejection proof , part self-help and part motivational/autobiography , which is being released this week . famously , in 2012 on his third day of the project , jiang asked austin , texas , krispy kreme manager -lrb- jackie braun -rrb- to make him five interlinked donuts to mimic the olympic symbol . to his surprise , she rose to the challenge and his rejection request faltered . he shared his video and it went viral on reddit . before long , jiang -lrb- and braun -rrb- were invited on talk shows and jiang was being asked to speak at events across the us . jiang was even offered jobs as his project continued and his fame grew . that was n't the goal of the project though . `` i 'm really just a person trying to overcome my own fears , '' explained jiang . the project started out to help `` fix my own problems , and now i 'm helping others fix theirs , '' he said . `` the fear of rejection really holds people back . i 'm trying to demystify the idea of rejection . '' jiang , who as a child dreamed of being bill gates and has been viewed 7 million times on youtube , has found his entrepreneurial dream in a different role for the moment . `` my goal is to turn rejection into opportunity . i always thought it was something to run away from , but if we can embrace it , we can turn it into a lot more than an obstacle . '' 8 top tips in making rejection work for you : . 1 - the fear of rejection holds us back a lot more than actual rejection . by putting ourselves out there , the world will usually open itself up to you . though the world can seem cruel and cold , actually humans have a hard time saying no . so open yourself up , do n't be afraid to ask for something . if you fail , remember it 's not about you . 2 - rejection is more or less a numbers game . sometimes the most far-fetched idea gets a yes . if you talk to enough people , somebody will say yes to you . j.k. rowling went through 12 rejections to get her yes for harry potter and the philosopher 's stone . 3 - you can not use rejection to measure the merit of an idea . sometimes if you really want to change the world , getting rejection is a must . rejection is a human interaction with two sides . it often says more about the rejector than the rejectee , and should never be used as the universal truth and sole judgment of merit . 4 - do n't run away after a no . the most common thing we do when we 're rejected is we want to run because rejection is painful - you 're hurt , angry and you lose confidence . but actually if we know how to handle it , we can often minimize the chance of rejection . be confident , engaging , collaborate . i used all of these traits to maximise getting a yes . 5 - ask why ? when you get rejected you have to find out why . then spend time to find solutions to solve that why . sometimes through this process you learn there is something else you can ask for . ask for an intermediate position rather than the top position . 6 - set a number of how many no 's you can take . in his book , jiang helps his wife set out to get her dream job at google . he tells her that instead of thinking about getting a job , she needs to prepare herself for how many no 's she can take . in the end , she was offered a job at google . 7 - be invincible . by the end of his project , jiang said he felt he could ask anything from anyone and not have the pain of rejection . it was a gradual process - gradually my comfort zone expanded . it 's like a muscle , i could become stronger and stronger . 8 - stand tall and remember rejection is an opinion . people are who they are . a lot of people will reject you because of their mood , their education , their upbringing , and you ca n't change who they are . but you can stand confidently . innate confidence comes across . how missing sleep can damage your iq . the surprising benefits of doing nothing . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .Z\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' a veteran of 64 test matches , benaud was inducted into the sport australia hall of fame in 1985 . while many regarded his voice as the soundtrack to an australian summer , benaud was equally revered by the cricketing public on the other side of the world where he spent more than four decades with the bbc taking the game into millions of british living rooms . but whether you were sitting in sydney or in south london , there were plenty of `` marvelous '' richie moments from the box to savor : . `` and glenn mcgrath dismissed for two , just ninety-eight runs short of his century . '' `` from our broadcasting box you ca n't see any grass at all . it is simply a carpet of humanity . '' `` captaincy is 90 % luck and 10 % skill . but do n't try it without that 10 % . '' news of his passing quickly generated a wave of condolences , including from australian prime minister tony abbott . `` to most australians richie benaud was cricket . he personified its traditions and its values , '' abbott said in a written statement friday . `` while many australians only know richard benaud as the voice of cricket , we should not forget that in his day he was a cricketer with few equals . it was why he was so insightful as a commentator . `` as a player his record has withstood the test of time . he led the australian side from 1958/59 through to 1963/1964 , never losing a series in his 28 tests as captain . `` as captain , he was first to lead a full australian tour to india and pakistan in 1959/60 . he was the first cricketer to reach a test double of 2,000 runs and 200 wickets . `` given the special place richie benaud has in our national life , i have asked that on the day of his funeral flags fly at half-mast . i extend my condolences and the condolences of the australian people , to his wife daphne and his family and friends . current australian captain michael clarke posted an image of benaud on instagram with the message : `` what a man . extremely sad day . you were a lot more then just a cricketer richie . rip . '' clarke 's former teammate shane warne also took to instagram to post a touching letter to the late commentator . he wrote : `` dear richie , i 've known you & daphne for close to 30 years & to everyone you were a legend on all levels & rightly so too . `` as a cricketer , commentator & as a person , you were the best there 's ever been & to top it off , an absolute gentleman ... for me it was an honour & a privilege to call you a close friend & mentor , we had so many wonderful times together , talking cricket & in particular , our love & passion of leg spin bowling . `` i will cherish our entertaining dinners & all the fun times we shared over a long period of time . i would also like to thank you & daphne for all your support & time you made for me as a young cricketer & leg spin bowler trying to make his way as an 18 year old , your tips & advice along the journey meant so much !!! `` richie , you were loved by everyone , not just the cricket family , you were the godfather of cricket & you will be missed by all ... r.i.p my friend . '' benaud , who was born in 1930 in penrith , new south wales , lead australia into an era of world dominance as a player . but it was after he hung up his spikes that his legendary status was confirmed . writing in a column in the australian , cricket writer gideon haigh wrote `` television was benaud 's calling , suiting his captain 's spontaneity and intuition . `` he was authoritative but not pedantic , dignified but not pompous , and never spoke unless he had something to say . he was so popular that many humorists strove to imitate him , so distinctive that none ever quite got him right . '' the bbc 's cricket correspondent jonathan agnew agreed . `` he was quite simply peerless . nobody else had his authority , popularity and skill , '' agnew said in a column on the bbc website . `` if you speak to any broadcaster from any sport , they will point to richie as the standard-bearer . '' australian national team coach darren lehmann said benaud set `` an incredibly high standard on and off the field . '' `` the fact that australia never lost a series under his captaincy says so much and those standards were just as high when he turned his attention to calling the game , '' he told cricket.com.au . `` we loved listening to him commentate when the team was together in the dressing room . when he was on air , we always had the tv volume turned up because his comments were so insightful . '' benaud 's passing also drew messages of sympathy on social media from beyond his native australia . imran khan , the former captain of pakistan and now a leading politician there , tweeted : `` saddened by the death of richie benaud , one of the greatest cricketing brains . '' while kumar sangakkara , the current captain of sri lanka 's test team , posted : `` so sad to hear about the passing of richie benaud . the great voice of cricket is no more . he defined an era with conviction and sincerity . '' british prime minister david cameron tweeted : `` i grew up listening to richie benaud 's wonderful cricket commentary . like all fans of the sport , i will miss him very much .

      "b\"\\xd6,-lrb- cnn -rrb- there 's an old saying which states the cape verde islands are home to a greater number of musicians per square kilometer than any other country in the world . in truth , such a definitive claim may be nigh on impossible to prove . but there is a certain factual accuracy behind the legend : the important and proud relationship the atlantic island country of just 500,000 people has with music . situated roughly 350 miles off the west coast of africa , cape verde has long been a mesh of cultures , history and races . the former portuguese territory was once a key location for the transatlantic slave trade , a target for 16th century pirates and a refuge for exiled jews . from this diverse melting pot were born the unique sounds of the batuque , morna , funana and other distinct musical styles . now , cape verde is seeking to tap-into the spoils of this rich cultural heritage in a bid to help its economy flourish . bereft of oil , gas , gold , diamonds or the conventional natural resources that have fueled growth in many other african countries , cape verde has had to look for alternative sectors to aid its development . and what 's more alternative than a jiving , swinging , musical economy ? `` besides fish , it is pretty common -lrb- for cape verde -rrb- to say ` our biggest richness is in music and culture , ' '' said christine semba of womex , an international networking platform for the world music genre . the economic potential of music has been also acknowledged by cape verde 's prime minister , jose maria neves , while the country 's ministry of culture is run by mario lucio de sousa , himself a popular musician . `` the future of our country lies in our capacity to create , our capacity to innovate , '' neves said in reference to the music and the arts at a world trade organization conference in 2013 . other elements of the creative economy include handicrafts , fashion and visual arts to name but a few . however , a 2013 report from the un conference on trade and development noted that cape verde 's creative sector remained a relatively small part of its economy with much room for improvement and long term planning . but that does n't mean there has n't been some promising early signs that music has the potential to play a key role in the future . one early musical success has been the kriol jazz festival . the event , which is celebrating its seventh edition , took place in the capital city of praia this past weekend . artists including grammy-winning u.s. singer esperanza spalding have been invited to perform , as have acts from the likes of luxembourg , brazil and , of course , cape verde . according to harold taveres , a liaison to the mayor of praia involved with promoting the festival , `` kjf has become one of the most spectacular events in cape verde . `` we breathe the music in cape verde , we live with the music , '' he added . `` now the festival has brought people from every corner in the world -lrb- to share in this -rrb- . '' during the festival , bars , hotels and restaurants are full to the brim while taxi drivers are seldom unable to find a fare during what locals refer to as `` the week of party . '' it 's a lucrative trade , for sure . yet in order to take full advantage of this bustling scene the country 's ministry of culture , alongside some enterprising private sector figures , thought a deeper relationship with the music business was required . enter the atlantic music expo , a three-year-old conference and networking event that seeks to help cape verdean artists secure international exposure . this year 's ame took place in the days before the kriol jazz festival . delegates , local musicians and their management teams were exposed to roundtables , workshops and talks on the intricacies of the global music business . `` we try to invite lots of producers and a lot of journalists from around the world to see the festival and the musicians from cape verde , '' said jose da silva , long time manager of the late cape verdean songstress cesaria evora . da silva is one of the driving forces behind ame as well as being the founder of the lusafrica and harmonia record labels that aim to discover a new generation of artists from cape verde . he hopes that by exposing musicians to a range of experienced industry professionals and top-level musicians , they will become equipped with the tools and ambition to take the music of cape verde across the globe . not only will this help launch the careers of artists and musicians -lrb- with all the respective behind the scenes business structures such developments require -rrb- but it will garner valuable attention for the country . this is where the greatest potential economic benefits lie . tourism is expected to account for 20 % of the country 's gdp by 2024 , according to research from the world travel and tourism council . getting cape verde 's name out on the world stage through recognition of its rich musical culture is therefore increasingly important . `` economically it 's beneficial for the country because the money we would have to spend on the market to give the country this exposure in the world would be too big , '' da silva said . `` this way it costs less money . '' semba agrees with this , and highlights the joined up thinking of the government and private sector actors like da silva for special praise . `` in the long term , the whole country is behind this event , '' semba said , adding `` this is a very innovative approach which we would like to see in many more countries . '' it must be noted , however , that few countries have the same natural resources for music as cape verde . more from marketplace africa .\\xbb\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' for centuries , these plays and three dozen more by william shakespeare have formed history 's most heralded literary canon . but now they may have to make room for an addition to shakespeare 's famous oeuvre . new research indicates that `` double falsehood , '' a play first published in 1728 by lewis theobald , was actually written more than a century earlier by shakespeare himself with help from his friend john fletcher . the findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the `` newer '' play . `` the match between the ` double falsehood ' play and shakespeare was a landslide . it was shockingly clear , '' said ryan l. boyd , a researcher at the university of texas at austin . the study , co-authored by boyd and ut colleague james w. pennebaker , was published in the journal psychological science . `` there 's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently . '' boyd said he and pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by shakespeare , nine by fletcher and 12 by theobald to create a `` psychological signature '' of each author based on word choices , phrase patterns and other factors . they compared those profiles to the language in `` double falsehood '' and determined that the play 's first half was almost entirely written by shakespeare , though the second half appeared to be split evenly between shakespeare and fletcher . only tiny traces of theobald 's signature were found . `` we 're certainly not suggesting that theobald did n't make edits , '' boyd told cnn . `` but he clearly did not write it . '' `` double falsehood , '' also known as `` the distressed lovers , '' is based on the `` cardenio '' section of don quixote , the classic 17th-century novel by miguel de cervantes . set in spain , the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers : one virtuous , one sinful . theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered , all of them written by shakespeare . but many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake , suspecting that theobald tried to pass the bard 's work off as his own . shakespeare , who died in 1616 , wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612 . british publishers arden shakespeare published `` double falsehood '' in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was shakespeare 's work . but the new study by boyd and pennebaker , the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective , may settle the matter once and for all . shakespearean scholar brean hammond , professor of modern english literature at nottingham university in the uk , praised the texas study for its scientific approach . hammond said boyd and pennebaker `` have got no dogs in the fight . they 're not literary scholars , -lrb- so -rrb- their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies . '' hammond studied `` double falsehood 's '' authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found shakespeare 's dna evident in the play . but he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest . `` those people who do n't believe the play was written by shakespeare are n't going to just lay down and die , '' he said .r\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' using the hashtag # 147notjustanumber , kenyans used social media to talk about the lives of the victims . they shared pictures of beaming faces , full of life and energy , in happier days . they talked about parents too shocked to speak after identifying their children 's bodies . some students remain unaccounted for , and wailing relatives alternate their searches between hospitals and morgues . kenyan authorities have not released the names of the victims . kenyan authorities had prior intelligence that a university in garissa could be attacked , yet the country 's rapid response team was stuck in nairobi for hours after the massacre awaiting transport , a police source said monday . the frozen accounts is the latest in a series of actions as the government faced heavy criticism for the siege , which lasted hours . a spokesman for president uhuru kenyatta said authorities `` got the job done '' and saved lives . the university had about 800 students . `` with the benefit of hindsight , you can always say things could have been done better , '' manoah esipisu said . kenya also launched airstrikes monday targeting al-shabaab 's training camps in somalia , according to a military source , who said they were not retaliation for last week 's massacre . `` the latest attack of al-shabaab bases by the kenya military is part of the ongoing operations that started in 2011 , '' the source said monday . kenya has also offered 20 million kenyan shillings , or about $ 215,000 , for information on the whereabouts of mohamed mohamud , who allegedly organized the attack . mohamud is a senior al-shabaab leader known by the aliases dulyadin and gamadhere , authorities said . al-shabaab is based in somalia , and its violence has spread to kenya before . in 2013 , militants attacked nairobi 's upscale westgate mall , leaving 67 people dead . the terror group has intensified attacks in kenya since the country sent troops to somalia four years ago to help battle the militants . cnn 's joseph netto reported from nairobi , and faith karimi reported and wrote from atlanta .\\xd0\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xad.-lrb- cnn -rrb- last month wu rongrong was taken into custody for planning to protest on international women 's day against sexual harassment in china . since then , the chinese authorities have formally detained her and four other activists for `` creating disturbances . '' they also briefly detained some of the activists ' supporters , raided a prominent nongovernmental organization that called for their release , and have at points denied some of the women access to medical treatment , lawyers and adequate rest . the fate of the five will be revealed by april 13 , as their case reaches the legal time limit when they must either be released or `` formally arrested , '' which almost always leads to conviction in china 's legal system . the timing of the detentions of china 's most inventive women 's rights activists is ironic : not only did they take place on the very day that marks women 's achievements and their struggle for equality , but they also come in a year in which beijing would have won praise for its role in promoting women 's rights . it appears poised to adopt its first and long-awaited anti-domestic violence law , which is expected to get a reading before the national people 's congress standing committee this summer . this year also marks the 20th anniversary of the influential fourth world conference on women hosted in beijing , during which hillary clinton famously declared that `` women 's rights are human rights . '' i first met wu at a conference several years ago , at a time when there were very few women in china 's weiquan or `` rights defense '' movement . it was common back then for male colleagues to publicly address them as `` babes '' or `` little sisters , '' even in professional -- and ostensibly progressive -- settings . as women 's rights activists , wu and others fight on two fronts : against overt rights violations by the chinese government and against the wider gender norms that relegate women to second-class citizens . by the time we met again two years later , wu and her young `` direct-action '' feminist colleagues were clearly off and running . they staged small , public `` performance art '' protests that attracted media headlines , energized the more mainstream and academically inclined women 's rights movement , and pushed women 's rights into the national consciousness and onto the government 's agenda . wu had an upbringing typical of her times . she comes from the countryside , which for many has changed beyond recognition within their lifetimes . in recent decades the economy has soared , but her generation is confronting the unhappy consequences of unchecked growth : pollution , unsafe foods and growing inequality between rich and poor . like many parents , she worries about how to find untainted milk powder for her infant boy , and whether to keep her child with her in the city or to send him to his grandparents in the countryside for a quieter , safer upbringing . many in wu and her colleagues ' generation are clear-eyed about the problems of china 's development model , and some want to address those . wu joined yirenping , a nonprofit organization that promotes social equality , whether it is between sexes or among people with and without disabilities , and later founded the women 's rights organization hangzhou women center . and it is in yirenping that she became particularly attuned to the challenges confronting young women in modern china . wu and her colleagues have used innovative tactics with a certain shock factor -- `` occupying '' public toilets to show the need for more such conveniences for women , donning blood-spattered wedding gowns to protest domestic violence , shaving their heads to protest against barriers to higher education for women -- that raises awareness of gender inequality in ways that resonate , especially with young women in the country . perhaps this is what the government finds threatening : that these activists epitomize the spirit of the times . they are young , confident , ready to challenge established norms , and most importantly , they feel responsible for their society and they want to improve it . as china prepares to mark the anniversary of the fourth world conference on women in september , it will be harder for the authorities to justify detaining these activists . but even if they are released , their work promoting women 's rights will have become exponentially more difficult . the women will now be labeled `` sensitive '' individuals at a time when the authorities are increasingly paranoid about independent groups , their role in fostering nonviolent protests and the overthrow of oppressive governments -lrb- known as `` color revolutions '' -rrb- , and foreign funding of civil society organizations . what wu and her colleagues are now enduring is consistent with a broader government effort to strangle independent activism . authorities have harassed and detained an ever expanding list of activists , and imprisoned others , but they have also tried to co-opt some groups by allowing them to provide services the government finds acceptable , so long as they abandon their activism . this kind of `` differentiated management '' of nongovernmental organizations -- punishing some but co-opting others -- may work to neutralize some of the more outspoken groups . but ultimately the desires for change among ordinary people that make wu and her friends ' campaigns so popular are unlikely to be answered through `` authoritarian activism '' alone . the chinese communist party now faces a dizzying array of challenges , not least that younger generations do not identify with the party or its values like past generations . rather than lengthening its list of challenges , the party could resolve some and lessen concerns about its legitimacy by freeing and engaging activists like wu and her colleagues , rather than treating them as criminals .\\x90\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe0)-lrb- cnn -rrb- hillary clinton finally answered the question we 've all been asking for years : will she run for president in 2016 ? with official news of her candidacy just hours old , one thing is already crystal clear : for the next year and a half , clinton will be the barometer by which we assess gender equality in the united states . win or lose , this creates a burden for her that no male candidate will ever have to shoulder . just consider the two potential outcomes . a win would mean a woman in the white house , which is a vital step in the march toward women 's full political inclusion . but it 's possible that the march will end right there . we 'll break our arms patting ourselves on the back for how far we 've come . we 'll raise the `` mission accomplished '' banner over the women 's movement . and we 'll call it a day . granted , 80 % of elected officials throughout the country will still be men . women will continue to be less likely than men even to consider running for office . and pay inequities , sexual assault and human trafficking will persist as challenges that no one person can solve , no matter how hard clinton might try . `` but we 've elected a woman as president , '' we 'll say . let her take care of it . a loss would be even more difficult . clinton will be blamed for running a subpar campaign regardless of how brilliant her strategy is . more generally , her loss would perpetuate the myth that women can not win big elections , that the electoral environment is rife with bias and discrimination , and that women must be twice as good to get half as far . `` if hillary clinton ca n't win an election , '' potential female candidates will ask , `` how can i ? '' extrapolating from one female candidate 's experiences to women in politics more broadly is always suspect . but in the case of clinton , it is particularly flawed for at least two fundamental reasons . first , clinton is no ordinary female presidential candidate , if there is such a thing . she began the 2008 race with levels of name recognition that many candidates never achieve , and she is even more well-known today . but that means that she also enters the electoral arena with 23 years of public accomplishments and 23 years of well-publicized baggage . voters , donors , journalists and pundits all hold clear impressions of clinton before she ever eats a corn dog in iowa , steps onto a debate stage in new hampshire or takes a shot of bourbon in kentucky . too often , we treat clinton 's loss to barack obama in the 2008 democratic primary as a referendum on how citizens feel about electing women to positions of political power . in reality , what people knew about hillary clinton likely shaped their views of hillary clinton . widespread sexism and misogyny likely did not . after all , for decades , women who have run for office have performed just as well as men . they win elections at equal rates and routinely raise comparable amounts of money . do some voters still question women 's suitability as leaders ? of course they do . but these attitudes , which have become increasingly rare , do not translate into systematic biases against female candidates . second , presidential politics is , first and foremost , a partisan affair . the d or r in front of the candidates ' names -- not the x or y chromosomes in their dna -- tells us about how more than 90 % of the population will vote . party polarization has essentially rendered the importance of sex on the campaign trail far less relevant than might otherwise be the case . now , i 'll be the first to predict that by the middle of the week , we will be able to assemble a reel of sexist comments uttered by pundits , and we will be one mouse click away from a steady stream of misogynistic memes , photos and captions that have taken hold on social media . the clinton campaign will once again have to determine which incidents to address , which to ignore and how to preempt future episodes . i do n't want to diminish the problems associated with this type of behavior or the fact that it is inappropriate , disrespectful and appalling . and incorporating these concerns into a broad campaign strategy is likely something that male candidates wo n't need to consider . but men yelling `` iron my shirt '' at a campaign rally , cable news pundits associating clinton with their ex-wives outside of probate court and manufacturers producing hillary clinton nutcrackers do not change the fact that when it comes to presidential elections , partisanship and the state of the economy tell us almost everything we need to know . if clinton wins the race , it will be because it was a good year for democrats . and if she loses , it will be because the gop developed a winning message . but how much does any of this really matter ? sure , voters are amenable to electing women . any democratic nominee would face the same electoral landscape . the problems confronting women in society are just as grave regardless of who occupies the white house . and inferring too much from hillary clinton 's experiences is a risky endeavor . yet the minute clinton announced her candidacy , she became the official litmus test for true gender equality in the united states . that 's a label that no female candidate should have to wear . let the burden begin .\\xbd\\x1b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb34-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a good thing -- a lucky thing -- that a bystander had the courage and presence of mind to record the shocking video that shows a white police officer , michael slager , gunning down and killing an apparently unarmed black man named walter scott after a traffic stop in north charleston , south carolina . and the resulting national wave of revulsion and indignation -- along with the prompt arrest of slager on murder charges -- is a welcome and appropriate response . but the event raises broad , troubling questions about how often such incidents take place without the benefit of a third-party recording . it 's not supposed to be a mystery : more than 20 years ago , congress approved a law , the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , signed by president bill clinton , that requires the federal justice department to collect data on deaths caused by police . the law has never truly been implemented , leaving us with patchy information about particular episodes rather than a comprehensive sense of how race and policing play out in america . `` what happened here today does n't happen all the time . what if there was no video ? what if there was no witness -- or hero , as i call him -- to come forward ? '' said l. chris stewart , an attorney for scott 's family . `` as you can see , the initial -lrb- police -rrb- reports stated something totally different . '' that 's putting it mildly . in early police statements -- issued before the video came to light -- slager reportedly said that scott attacked him , that he fired only after a scuffle and that cops made medical efforts to revive scott . the video makes hash of those claims , and likely contributed to slager 's swift arrest and pending murder charges . `` when you 're wrong , you 're wrong , '' said north charleston mayor keith summey . that leaves slager to face murder charges that could land him on death row -- and the rest of us to face a disturbing reality . i 'm all for having police use body cameras , although they are not a magic cure for preventing or stopping the excessive use of force . but the much bigger problem is that we simply do n't know when and where police killings take place , or whether they cluster in particular cities or states . and that means we do n't know for certain whether unjustified or excessive force correlates with particular forms of officer training or detectable underlying racial bias . we do n't even know the role played by officers operating under stressful conditions or while dealing with mental or physical illness . these vital questions are n't supposed to be a mystery . according to section 210402 of the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 , `` the attorney general shall , through appropriate means , acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers . ... the attorney general shall publish an annual summary of the data acquired under this section . '' that section of the law has effectively been ignored , beyond a first attempt at a comprehensive report published in 1996 . by 2001 , a new york times article noted that when it comes to police uses of deadly force , `` no comprehensive accounting for all of the nation 's 17,000 police department exists . '' there are multiple reasons the law has been ignored . collecting information from the nation 's thousands of jurisdictions -- the myriad villages , counties and cities -- is a tough , expensive assignment . the job is even harder because many police departments , reluctant to air their dirty laundry , fail to distinguish between justified and unjustified killings on the reasonable grounds that it 's up to the courts to rule on whether an officer has committed brutality -- something that 's often established only after years of court proceedings . these hurdles could be overcome by a determined effort from washington , but congress has failed to press the justice department to demand the data and comply with the 1994 law . a weak substitute called the death in custody reporting act was passed in 2000 and renewed in 2014 , but it is a voluntary reporting program intended to coax information out of local departments . some of the data gap has been filled by media organizations -- and what they have discovered only underscores the need for muscular , mandatory enforcement of the data-gathering law . in 2011 , the las vegas review-journal published an extensive investigation of police killings in and around las vegas and found 378 shootings over a 20-year period , 142 of which were fatal . in no case was an officer convicted or even fired because of an on-duty shooting . in south carolina last month , the state newspaper published an examination of 209 instances in which officers shot at suspects , and found that only a handful of officers were charged , and none found guilty . `` in south carolina , it remains exceedingly rare for an officer to be found at fault criminally for shooting at someone , '' the columbia newspaper concluded . a group of activists has created a website called mappingpoliceviolence.org that flags cases of police killings ; its estimate that at least 304 black people were killed by police in 2014 may stand as the best guess we have about the dimensions of a national problem . but we should n't be guessing . as the las vegas review-journal editorialized in 2011 : `` how many lives might be saved if taxpayers everywhere were better informed about police shootings ? how can they know about a potential local problem without information ? ... police already track everything from domestic violence to child abuse to murder , and police routinely lobby state and federal lawmakers to put new crimes into statute . the budgetary impact of adding another reporting category to local police forces would be minuscule . the social impact of such an addition , however , would be huge . '' that common-sense observation is being echoed by the obama administration -- specifically , the president 's task force on 21st century policing , created in december in response to widespread protests following the police killings of unarmed black men including michael brown and eric garner . the recently released interim report of the task force calls , one more time , for the justice department to collect comprehensive data from local departments . but it will take more pressure -- from activists , victims ' families , members of congress and president barack obama himself -- to demand an end to the stonewalling of information . it 's long past time we got to the truth of how many more killings like walter scott 's are happening without a video to set the record straight .\\x9a\\x1b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x895-lrb- cnn -rrb- recently , nashville 's district attorney banned prosecutors from offering female sterilization in plea deals . believe it or not , nashville prosecutors have offered this option four times in the past five years . there has been public outrage at the notion that a defendant in america in 2015 would be offered a choice of sterilization as part of a plea deal . except , it happens all the time . some have claimed this practice `` evokes a dark corner of american history '' where the mentally ill or `` deficient '' were forced to undergo sterilization . yeah , that 's true . we did that . and it was bad . except this is n't quite that . female sterilization is linked to the controversial `` eugenics '' movement , which advocated for the notion that the human race can be improved by selective breeding of people with superior genes . there is even a 1927 supreme court case , buck v. bell , in which the justices ruled that a state statute permitting compulsory sterilization of the unfit and `` imbeciles , '' `` for the protection and health of the state , '' was constitutional . the opinion in the case is stunning , especially because the supreme court has never technically overruled it . but buck v. bell dealt with involuntary sterilization of people because of their mental disabilities , not because they were being punished for a crime . you can hate sterilization , and the tennessee case may have the creepy feel of the antiquated practice of eugenics , but it 's not that . present-day sterilization plea deals involve a voluntary choice of sterilization by persons accused of a crime , and for whom sterilization will be part of their punishment . others may argue that the supreme court has already spoken on the issue of compulsory sterilization as punishment , and struck it down . that 's true too , sort of . in skinner v. oklahoma , the court struck down a law permitting compulsory sterilization of criminals as unconstitutional , but not because it was cruel and unusual . instead , the law was struck down because the law was unequally applied for similar crimes . so the question remains : is sterilization as a punishment unconstitutional ? the eighth amendment provides : `` excessive bail shall not be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted . '' practically , however , punishments are rarely deemed cruel and unusual by the judiciary . we have executed people with hangings and by firing squad . sterilization has to be somewhere below that , right ? ultimately , however , the constitutionality of sterilization may be a red herring in this analysis , because it appears that even if a punishment vciolates the constitution , it is permissible , if you willingly choose it . suppose arguendo -lrb- for argument 's sake -rrb- that sterilization is judicially labeled a cruel and unusual punishment , violating the eighth amendment . this is where it gets interesting : it still might be an appropriate and constitutional part of a plea deal . shocked ? you should n't be . as citizens , we validly waive our constitutional rights all the time . you waive your fourth amendment protections against search and seizure when you answer `` yes '' to an officer 's `` mind if i look in your trunk ? '' you waive your fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination when you try to explain to the detective in the interrogation room how that body got in your vehicle 's trunk . so then , if we can validly waive our other constitutional rights , can we waive our eighth amendment rights and choose a cruel and unusual punishment , even if it would otherwise be unconstitutional ? and are people outraged because this is a new step in punishment or a new frontier and a slippery slope in the world of plea deals ? nope . sterilization statutes have been around for a while as punishment for defendants all over the country , and defendants have willingly chosen the procedure . if sterilization plea deals are likely constitutional , and we 've been doing it for a while , then that begs the question : why the outrage now ? why the story that a tennessee prosecutor was fired for a plea bargain that appears to be widely practiced ? there are really only two possibilities . first , some people just had no idea that this was going on until this story hit the news . second , even if we knew about it , we did n't mind the practice until now because of one fundamental difference . most of the sterilization defendants are men . search your feelings , luke . when we talk about castrating men who are recidivist sexual predators and child molesters , the idea of castration as punishment does n't sound so bad right ? be honest : let go of your `` we 're - all-equal-in-all-ways '' banner for a moment . after all , not too long ago , execution was a legal punishment for nonhomicide sex crimes in some jurisdictions . so if we 're ok with the gas chamber , we 're probably ok with a snip . it 's ok . you can admit it ; we are all hardwired with a modicum of gender bias , whether we like it or not . still not convinced ? watch this parlor trick : what if i suggested sterilization for a person convicted of having sex with a minor ? so far you 're not ruling it out . and what if it 's a young female high school teacher having sex with her 17-year-old student ? most of our gut feelings shifted from `` maybe '' to `` no '' just now . it 's ok to admit that , too . of course , sterilization wo n't prevent a female sex offender from offending again , no more than sterilization will prevent a male offender from offending again . but the point is , somehow , the notion of sterilizing a male criminal somehow sits better with us than sterilizing a female criminal . maybe it 's that on a primal , unconscious level , what feels cruel and unusual punishment for a woman just feels less so for a man . even if you 're offended by this theory of why an old practice is now a `` shocking '' news story , you must concede it fits . why else has castration of men not been a blip on the radar , but offering a woman the option of sterilization is suddenly a travesty ? of course , we have to consider the related justification . overall , a lot more men commit acts that merit sterilization than do women . just ask any domestic violence prosecutor . are sterilization plea deals morally right ? it 's hard to say . for now , they appear to be constitutional , but controversial . if we know a mother is likely to kill or seriously hurt her current children or her unborn child , should the government step in ? if so , to what degree ? fortunately , we can avoid a final decision and continue to attack the problem in a way that seems to be more acceptable for now : just keep neutering the men .d\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' yet , afalava has been denied the right to vote because the federal government insists that he is no citizen . how can it be , in the 21st century , that americans born on u.s. soil are denied the rights of citizenship ? that injustice clouds the recent celebration of the 115th anniversary of the decision of american samoa to join the united states . it is a wrong that afalava and other american samoans are now seeking to right in a federal lawsuit before the d.c. circuit . a decision could come any day . since the united states was established , it adhered to the rule that those born on u.s. lands were u.s. citizens . the rule is colorblind , yet the only exception that the supreme court has ever declared was not . the infamous dred scott case legitimized slavery as it declared that free african-americans had `` no rights that the white man was bound to respect . '' though they were americans , they were not citizens under the constitution . a civil war later , the 14th amendment reversed the ruling in the dred scott case . today , the dred scott case has come to be regarded as one of the worst decisions in the history of the supreme court . but racial discrimination did n't end there . in 1904 , a puerto rican woman named isabel gonzalez sailed for new york . because puerto rico was u.s. territory , she believed herself to be a u.s. citizen . but officials at ellis island labeled her an undesirable alien and prevented her from entering the mainland . she sued , with some reason to hope for a favorable ruling . yet the supreme court that eventually heard gonzalez 's case was still racist . in preceding years , for example , it had permitted a flat ban on naturalizing anyone of the chinese race . and , in a case addressing the status of recently acquired island territories such as puerto rico , the justices had cited the alleged racial inferiority of tropical peoples as reason to treat these lands as second-class u.s. territories . justice edward douglas white 's opinion stated that u.s. sovereignty extended over them , but that their residents did not hold the same constitutional rights as other americans . he did so , he privately revealed , because `` he was much preoccupied by the danger of racial and social questions . '' in the gonzalez case , the justices agreed unanimously that puerto ricans were not aliens and thus not subject to immigration laws . but they declined to decide whether or not gonzalez was a citizen . though preoccupied by fears that islanders were `` savages '' and racially unfit for citizenship , they were unwilling to violate the constitution . as a result of the court ruling , federal officials were able to deny gonzalez and others the full panoply of rights conferred on citizens for years . as isabel gonzalez 's lawyer told the court , declaring that residents of america 's island territories are not u.s. citizens would mean adding to `` precedents in our history of which we are least proud . '' those precedents , he warned the court , had been `` repudiated by the american people in the civil war , by three amendments to the constitution of the united states , by this court , and by ... advancing civilization . '' surely , 147 years after the dred scott case was overturned , the time has come to put an end to this farce . in the past century , the inhabitants of every other u.s. island territory have become citizens . today , emy afalava and his fellow american samoans are the last americans still waiting to become citizens .J\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' many americans read such numbers and worry : will this mean more dzhokhar tsarnaevs ? but that 's only if you believe islam causes extremism , which many have argued . and that 's wrong , of course . on the other hand , there are people who claim islam has nothing to do with terrorism . which is true -- and false . sure , the islamic faith forbids murder , but there 's a small but significant minority of muslims murdering people in terrible ways , and in islam 's name . understanding what leads young muslims like dzhokhar down a dangerous path requires we understand radicalization . at any given moment in the middle east , we have little idea who 's going to attack whom next , who 's on whom 's side , how this is going to end , or what anyone 's even fighting over anymore . this bad news is going to turn worse before it gets better . but it will get better . to understand why , we have to take a stab at understanding what radicalizes muslims . contrary to common belief , muslims are n't unusually predisposed to violence . radical islam , which has taken on an ugly life of its own , began at the intersection of politics , religion and religious identity . islam is about what you believe , but it 's also about being part of a community . and what happens when you are a member of a community and you see it under attack ? some muslims who have turned to violence have done so with good intentions -lrb- the road to hell , after all -rrb- . consider : the tragedy of modern islam is in its endless sequence of tragedies . before my time , the brutal soviet invasion of afghanistan horrified many muslims . when i was in high school , bosnia occupied all our attention . there was of course russia 's brutal war on the chechen people -- dzhokhar shares his name with a recent chechen patriot -- and israel 's ongoing occupation of the palestinian territories . and the blows against muslims do n't end there . there was serbia 's war on kosovo , another war in chechnya , the invasion of iraq , oppression in myanmar , civil strife in syria , the colonization of east turkestan , massacres of muslims in the central african republic , wars on a besieged gaza and west bank still under israeli rule . imagine how this looks to a restless young muslim . countless places where co-religionists have been killed , and nobody seems to do anything about it . nobody even wants to . extremists have long offered crude reasons for why the violence was happening , and then moved quickly to a single , tempting , terrible response : take up arms -- and kill . in her new book , `` heretic : why islam needs a reformation now '' , ayaan hirsi ali argues that extremism is n't caused by political circumstances , but by islam itself . her conclusion is wrong . to fight extremism , we do n't need to reform islam . we need to show young muslims that extremism is doing the opposite of what it claimed to . rather than help muslims , it 's harming them . when i was a teenager , our massachusetts mosque hosted a delegation from bosnia that shared graphic , heartbreaking stories of rape , exile , and massacre inflicted on muslims , all because of their faith . the mosque raised money , collected food , blankets , medicine . promises were made to provide more , and regularly . but we all knew that was n't enough . as we left the mosque , my peers and i were disgruntled and confused . shocked . angry . our teachers could 've told us : go and fight . defend your muslim brothers and sisters who are under siege . or they could 've told us to keep our heads down and make money and live comfortably . neither answer would have satisfied . fortunately for us , they offered us a third way . they showed us , patiently , how to work with others , how to compromise , how to get things done . a more engaged american muslim community , they explained , could use its resources to help people suffering all around the world . they were right . we saw the dead-end road of radicalism from afar , but we also saw , up close , how communities that isolated themselves and turned inward found themselves powerless , ineffectual and ignored . thanks to social media , a medium that the world 's burgeoning young muslim population is increasingly comfortable with , more muslims can and will see this , too . radicalism will be done in by fellow muslims who want to save their religion from this monster within it . it 's happening already . our national conversation about islam is focused on the wrong issues . does islam need a reformation ? what in islam causes violence ? we would do a lot better if we accepted that muslims the world over have real grievances -- dictatorships , corruption , foreign intervention , religious illiteracy , lack of economic opportunity -- and radicals exploit these . we need to show the young dzhokhars that , if they want to help , then violence is n't going to help . to fight extremism , we need to pose this question to young muslims : `` do you want to help your brothers and sisters in faith ? '' because those who claim to be defending us are making things so much worse . their narrative has failed . their solution is bankrupt . the caliph wears no clothes . it 's the reason why increasing numbers of muslims reject extremism -- and not just because our numbers are increasing .\\xef\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' and i would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay . the fact is , when you embrace diversity , you will still leave out other minority groups . redheads , for example , are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color . in fact , supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures . even expanding the flags represented by emojis , as apple has done , comes at some peril . apparently canada is overjoyed that finally apple has included it . but armenians are not happy they were left out . i must admit that being partially of palestinian heritage , it 's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a palestinian state , apple has chosen to now include a palestinian flag emoji . armenia , i feel your pain . of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is : what took apple so long ? how hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from ? that the company -lrb- finally -rrb- did is a step in the right direction : america 's demographics are changing , so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this . apple has `` evolved '' in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples . maybe `` religious liberty '' conservatives who discriminate will follow .2\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b'\\xf2\"-lrb- cnn -rrb- i \\'m haunted by the video of officer michael slager firing eight shots at walter scott as he fled his encounter with north charleston police -- his back turned to the officer . what i find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while slager appears to plant an item next to his body . i understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement . if not for the video taken by a bystander , i ca n\\'t help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation . as a defense attorney , i am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime , but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation . thank god there was a camera . it will help ensure that justice will be served in this case . however , there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy : a police body camera . throughout the entire encounter with scott , it \\'s clear slager had no idea someone was filming him . had he known there would be video of his every move , would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man ? would he have fired ? eight times ? would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report ? of course not . if slager had been wearing a body camera , scott would probably still be alive , and slager would n\\'t be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence . body cameras are expensive to deploy , sure . and storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more . that cost , however -- if we \\'re talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to scott \\'s family in an inevitable civil suit against the north charleston police department . most importantly , we have to ask ourselves this : what \\'s the value of a human life ? certainly it \\'s worth the price of some mass data storage . and there \\'s something else at stake . the public is losing confidence in law enforcement , and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point . every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street . as fear ratchets up , so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve . as tension rises , the risk of more shootings increases . it is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos . police body cameras can help break this cycle . studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera . complaints against cops decrease , and , most importantly , use-of-force incidents drop . i will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution . they only help compensate for the real underlying problem , which is this : there is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system , and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men . when we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other south carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver \\'s license -- it \\'s clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions , even routine actions , from black men as potentially aggressive . these may not be overtly racist cops . they may not intentionally treat black men differently , but we ca n\\'t pretend that black men are n\\'t being disproportionately targeted . all across the country , we see it happening , and with the proliferation of video , we \\'re seeing it happen with alarming frequency . somehow , we \\'re going to have to beat this bias out of our system . set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops . institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it . as a society , we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income , education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation . but social change , sadly , may take generations of hard work . in the meantime , if we ca n\\'t immediately root out racial bias , we can at least put a bright spotlight on it , and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops .\\xe1\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

      "b\"\\x99\\x1flondon -lrb- cnn -rrb- the pentagon released a map this week showing coalition forces have taken back 25-30 % of iraqi territory seized by isis . the map , above , shows gains in key central and northern areas of iraq where the terror group was previously the dominant force . the gains made in the fight against the terror group by iraqi security forces and coalition air power certainly look impressive -- although as the u.s. department of defense acknowledges it 's a dynamic conflict and territory can change hands depending on `` daily fluctuations in the battle lines . '' so , how exactly should we read this information ? what does it say about the wider fight against isis ? cnn asked afzal ashraf , a counterinsurgency specialist and consulting fellow at the royal united services institute to give us a steer on what this new data tells us about the fight against isis in iraq . below is an edited version of the conversation . cnn : so , is the tide turning in iraq -- is the coalition winning ? afzal ashraf : when it comes to insurgencies it 's always problematic to think about the tide turning in terms of territorial gains because insurgencies by their very nature are extremely good at adapting to change . the one difference between isis and insurgencies in general is that isis declared itself a state , a caliphate once had territory so any loss is very strategic loss of prestige and image for them . -lrb- there have been -rrb- significant gains against isis -- particularly in tikrit -- and it 's no coincidence we 've seen isis make spectacular attacks in refugee centers in syria . it 's asymmetric warfare , they know they can not hold conventional force back for very long so what they do is they withdraw ... then take initiative elsewhere . they have to distract attention from those losses by gains and attacks elsewhere . it continues their image of initiative , of shocking , of reshaping the world -- which is what they are trying to do . cnn : what does the map tell us about the coalition 's strategy ? aa : it 's very telling . there are losses but most of the losses are around the edges of their territory and what that means is a very conventional push forward by the iraqi forces . it 's a push against the front line of isis rather than being brave and creative and going in behind isis 's lines and breaking it up . what this is n't is using maneuverist warfare -- which is a military philosophy that exploits the capabilities of conventional forces to project power by using air forces to take land along main supply routes and put friendly forces on that land to cut land into chunks which causes massive disruption to command and control and their supply chains which can cause forces to collapse much more rapidly than a frontal push . the capability you need -lrb- for this kind of warfare -rrb- is much more high-tech than the capabilities the iraqis have . those capabilities are available in the region -- jordanians , egyptians and other forces have helicopters and aircraft -- and it 's very interesting that the middle eastern nations have not developed an effective coalition to target isis which is an existential threat . cnn : what about ramadi ? isis seems to be winning there . aa : ramadi has been a potential battlefield for the past decade . but in this context -lrb- isis -rrb- will ... be pushing in ramadi because that 's an area they have lots of support . it also diverts their attention away from losses to their gains . the concept of success is hugely important to them -- it 's what sustains the recruitment effort of isis . nobody wants to join a bunch of losers , so it 's very important for them to be seen to be succeeding . above all this is a rhetorical war that is being fought deliberately in the media . they are losing so of course they are going to try to distract us by destroying ancient statues in nimrud and killing refugees in camps like yarmouk . but where it counts they are not standing and fighting .\\xf7\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' that 's what he 's more known for but his first passion is music . he 's an incredible producer , writer and singer . i just felt like he was always the missing piece . he brought everything together . cnn : so now that you 've found your `` missing piece , '' how would you describe your sound ? siham : our music before was experimenting with afrobeat sounds but now it 's more of a fusion -lrb- of what -rrb- we are inspired by . it 's pop with undertones of hip hop and rhythmic african percussion . it 's a fusion of everything . cnn : and do you guys write the songs as well ? siham : the entire album was pretty much -lrb- written and produced -rrb- by me , my sister and elijah . and when we signed we already had a lot of those songs already done . warner brothers records is really great in that way that they already loved what we were doing and let us do our own thing . cnn : what are you listening to right now ? siham : oh my god , there 's so many ! iman : sia with `` chandelier . '' siham : i really love this new song -- i do n't know if iman is going to agree with me -- but his name 's lunchmoney lewis , it 's called bills ; i love it . cnn : as well as your music , you both work with the u.n. high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- -- how did you start your humanitarian work ? iman : ever since we were kids we wanted to help somalia , we always talked about it . but we were like `` what can we physically do ? '' we were doing some research and we called our mom and she said ` you know you still have family over there . there 's a refugee camp in kenya and your great uncle and his kids live in a refugee camp . ' and we did some research about dadaab refugee camp , it 's a massive camp that has taken in sudanese refugees , somali refugees , rwandan refugees -- pretty much anywhere there was a conflict . everybody fled to dadaab . in the beginning -lrb- it was -rrb- pure advocacy talking about it on twitter and facebook . cnn : but then you decided to `` up your game '' as it were ... iman : yes , then we started a non-profit and we 'd do small benefit concerts in toronto and in san diego -- wherever there was a big somali community we would do outreach but all we had was our singing , working with unhcr in a capacity as a spokesperson . we headlined world refugee day at the kennedy center , as well as the nansen awards twice in geneva . we felt like this platform of singing -- the bigger it gets , the more we can do . siham : we obviously love fashion so we wanted to do our own socially conscious brand so we 've been making these bracelets and necklaces called `` wish creatively . '' wish stands for `` women internationally selling hope . '' we wanted to do a socially conscious brand where we sell these bracelets where it goes back to projects in kenya or somalia with women providing them with a sustainable income . cnn : so what 's next for you two ? siham : we 're actually in the mixing process right now . we still have a few -lrb- tracks -rrb- to finish up but the majority of the album is pretty much done . we want to turn it in as soon as possible so they can put together a rollout plan and get ready for the first single to drop . iman : i do n't feel like we ever lost that feeling like we 're creative spokespersons for our generation as well as for somalia . i feel like now because we followed our dreams it 's like ` they 're not just refugees anymore . ' we do n't have to become doctors so we can one day give back to somalia and help rebuild -- it 's such a beautiful dream but not ours . in our culture , anything creative is not really respected or appreciated . but i feel like now but even with our new deal we 're still trucking along . i feel like we inspire people . read this : nigerian soul singer nneka is back ! read this : angelique kidjo takes no prisoners . more from african voices ..\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' while the battle for yarmouk is very typical of syria 's civil war , the conflict here is unique . most of those fighting on all sides are palestinians . pro-government factions besiege the area from the outside , cutting off supplies and aid most of the time . the inside is held by anti-regime groups , some of which are islamists . the situation in yarmouk was thrust in to the headlines on april 1 when isis fighters stormed the rebel-held area and unleashed a campaign of violence and killings . since then , a local activist tells cnn , isis has withdrawn to another area and left the al qaedalinked group jabhat al-nusra in charge of the district . ` the deepest circle of hell ' : terrified yarmouk residents describe isis raid . but this is only the most recent in a deadly urban war that is slowly grinding down yarmouk 's buildings and people . of the more than 100,000 that used to live there , only about 18,000 remain , according to unrwa , the u.n. agency tasked with aiding palestinians . i have been to yarmouk on various occasions , and the picture has always been the same . pro-government factions surrounded the area and there was house-to house combat , mostly at night . a lot of destruction , very little territorial gain for either side , all of it taking a horrifying toll on the civilians trapped in the middle . `` we have no food or water , '' one resident said , standing amid the ruins of yarmouk 's houses . `` they should open a route so we can eat and drink and they can deliver assistance and food . we have nothing . what can we do ? '' but international aid groups can do very little . there are few occasions where aid is allowed into yarmouk , or where civilians are allowed out . unrwa can only care for those who do manage to escape . u.n. official to visit besieged refugee camp . the agency , along with the syrian arab red crescent , runs several shelters for displaced people in government-controlled areas near the camp . pierre krahenbuhl , the commissioner general for unrwa , recently visited some of them and acknowledged that far too little help was reaching those who need it most . `` we have to call on the world and call on all the actors in the world who can influence the situation to mobilize , '' krahenbuhl said . `` but much more has to be done to respect the civilians and to make sure that they are safe inside the camp . '' but of course those still inside are by no means safe -- subjected to shelling , bombing and street combat on top of being thirsty , hungry and in need of medication . but one thing that has not been broken is the residents ' self-respect and pride . `` this is yarmouk camp and we are not leaving our homes , '' one man said . `` whatever happens , if they keep hitting us with barrel bombs we will die . '' an elderly woman recalled her life as a palestinian refugee . `` i fled palestine when i was seven years old , '' she said . `` but i will not leave the yarmouk camp even if i am 75 or 76 years old . yarmouk camp is equal to my soul . i built it with my bare hands . i carried its stones on my head from a village and laid the foundation to my home . block by block i carried them on my head . '' but despite their defiance , there 's seemingly nothing that can be done to prevent yarmouk from being reduced to rubble . this is a war of attrition , two sides fighting for inches in tough combat without seeing that they are wrecking the prize they claim to be fighting for . desperation for palestinians trapped in syrian refugee camp .\\xa2\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe3\\x1a-lrb- cnn -rrb- ursula ward kept repeating her son 's name -- odin . she steadied herself against the podium in the fall river , massachusetts , courtroom and occasionally paused . she was tired after more than two years of pain , punctuated wednesday when her son 's killer , aaron hernandez , was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison . odin lloyd was her first born , her only son . `` odin was the backbone of the family . odin was the man of the house . odin was his sisters ' keeper , '' ward told judge susan garsh , before garsh sentenced the former pro-football player . lloyd was 27-years-old and working for a landscaping firm when he was killed in june 2013 . he played football for the boston bandits , the oldest semi-pro team in boston and the winner of four championships in the new england football league , according to the team 's website . his mother , sister , uncle and cousin described him as a champion of family , a gifted athlete and a hard worker with a sense of humor . they said he rode his bike several miles to get to work . he went to all of his niece 's recitals . `` odin was my first best gift i -lrb- will -rrb- ever receive , '' his mother said . `` i thank god -lrb- for -rrb- every second and every day of my son 's life that i spent with him . `` the day i laid my son odin to rest , '' she continued , pausing to maintain her composure , `` i think my heart stopped beating for a moment . i felt like i wanted to go into that hole with my son , odin . '' she can still hear him talking to her : '' ` ma , did you cook ? ma , go to bed . ma , you 're so beautiful . ' '' ed lloyd followed ward to address the judge . odin lloyd 's uncle thanked everyone who worked on the case against hernandez . his nephew , he said , `` meant a lot to me . '' `` to see how he grew , the respect he had , the toughest thing for me is that i wo n't get to see him have a child ... , '' ed lloyd said . he loved watching his nephew and his son together . `` a lot of people wo n't see from the outside the value and the riches -lrb- odin lloyd -rrb- had , '' he said . `` i 'm sorry for where i stand today but i know that all the time i had with him was special and he 'll always be with me . '' who was odin lloyd ? odin lloyd 's sister olivia thibou wept as she explained what it has felt like to lose her brother . `` these last couple years have been the hardest of our lives , '' she said , recalling that she was asked to writer her brother 's eulogy . `` i got to write all the great memories i have of him . '' she laughed , recalling his insistence on wearing the same adidas flip-flops until the soles wore away . he was `` prideful , '' she said . he would take her car out and just when she was starting to angry , he 'd pull in with the car shining and clean , inside and out . he taught her daughter how to ride a bike . his murder , she said , `` feels like a bad dream . '' ward told the court that she constantly thinks about her son . `` i miss my baby boy odin so much , '' she said . `` but i know i 'm going to see him again someday and that has given me the strength to go on . '' she has also apparently gained strength from the act of forgiveness . `` i forgive the hands of the people that had a hand in my son 's murder , '' she said . `` i pray and hope that someday everyone out there will forgive them also .

      "b\"\\x90!-lrb- cnn -rrb- danny kahneman , my good friend and co-author who got a nobel prize in economics , once helped to run an experiment involving patients undergoing colonoscopies . one group received a mildly pleasurable experience at the end of the procedure ; the other group , which experienced the same type of colonoscopy , did not . it turns out that the group for whom things ended well had significantly more positive recollections of the whole affair from its beginning . the psychology of it is simple to understand : happy endings matter . even an unpleasant experience can lead to happy memories in hindsight if it ends well . so too with taxes . let 's just say that when it comes to taxes for the average american , `` stuff '' happens -lrb- keeping the colonoscopy metaphor running -rrb- , paycheck to tax-reduced paycheck . but recent statistics suggest that 8 out of 10 american taxpayers get a refund when they file their taxes , and the average amount is close to $ 3000 . that pays for a lot of stuff . to make the good news even better , tax filing has gotten rather simple for most people , with various software and service providers offering to do the dreaded paperwork for free . no filing headaches and a check to boot . what 's not to like ? the fact of the matter is there is plenty not to like when it comes to the u.s. tax system . for example , the laws are biased against two-worker marriages ; taxes go up when two relatively equal earners marry , as the rate brackets for couples are less than double that for single filers . taxes are also overly complex and essentially optional for the truly rich , who make their wealth off of their existing wealth , the largely untaxed returns from capital , rather than by getting ordinary paychecks like most of us . but now is not the time to explain such serious matters ; the people are too busy spending their refunds . the once dreaded tax day has become a happy spending spree for most americans . this state of short-term bliss follows from some deep trends in our tax laws . in brief , the u.s. income tax system is increasingly a wage tax , with limited taxes on capital -lrb- what the rich have -rrb- and limited deductions for most of us . for example , 3 out of 4 americans using a standard deduction get no break for their charitable contributions . all of this has been hashed and rehashed by politicians , professors and pundits . but who has time for that ? let 's go to our television sets and check out the commercials . one clever spot ran during the recent super bowl , suggesting that the boston tea party -- a tax revolt -- could have been averted with free online filing , which the sponsor was eager to provide . filling out 1040s was part of what made the income tax so odious for the masses for such a long time -- who does n't remember our parents fretting over shoeboxes of receipts sometime in april , the cruelest month ? now as tax day approaches , we are flooded with advertisements about america getting its billions back , without even having to pay to prepare the forms . we get paid to play ! here is the happy ending that kahneman and others have shown can mitigate the memories of unpleasantness past . the simple fact is that a simple tax is also rather simple to administer . service providers kindly offer to help out the masses of befuddled americans . of course , these kind souls want their happy endings too . they are betting that once the large refunds become obvious to their customers , the grateful taxpayers-turned-consumers will happily purchase add-on services , such as `` audit protection insurance , '' or perhaps deposit the money in financial accounts managed by the provider . just as lottery winners notoriously go on impulsive spending sprees , the `` found money '' of tax returns can finance many nice purchases . of course , there are still those annoying matters of the deep unfairness of the tax laws , biased against modern families and wage earners , and in favor of the rich living off capital . no real bother -- stuff happens . let others fret about fairness . as long as our taxpaying or colon procedures end with a smile -- or a check -- who has time to dwell on the bad stuff that came before ?\\xc0\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' hernandez 's lawyers have argued he could n't defend himself properly while on trial in massachusetts . there was no criminal charge in the case . and then there is the grievance over unpaid bonus money filed by the nfl players union on behalf of hernandez , who signed a contract in 2012 that potentially was worth more than $ 40 million . if the grievance is heard by the league , hernandez will be represented by the the national football league players ' association . who was odin lloyd ? cnn 's lawrence crook contributed to this report .\\x17\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf1/-lrb- cnn -rrb- as americans mark the 150th anniversary of abraham lincoln 's death this week , let us remember that he not only belongs to the ages , but also belongs , in a special way , to illinois . lincoln 's two greatest legacies -- indivisible union and irreversible emancipation -- grew organically from his midwestern roots . he knew firsthand that no defensible border shielded the land of corn from the land of cotton . the entire region from the appalachians to the rockies drained through the mississippi river , enabling farmers in this vast basin to float their goods down to market through new orleans and from there to the world . he thus could never allow a potentially hostile power to control this geostrategic chokepoint in particular , or dixie more generally . the u.s. landmass , he insisted , `` is well adapted to be the home of one national family ; and it is not well adapted for two , or more '' because `` there is no line , straight or crooked , suitable for a national boundary upon which to divide . '' lincoln supplemented his midwestern geography lesson with a distinctly midwestern claim about constitutional history : `` the union is older than any of the states ; and in fact , it created them as states . '' lincoln did not need to make this controversial claim to prove his case , and elsewhere he stressed the decisive legal point that the constitution 's text clearly prohibits unilateral secession . the constitution is always and everywhere the supreme law of the land -- no matter what an individual state says . but lincoln 's additional assertion that the union created the states , not vice versa , provoked strong disagreement in other parts of the country . most virginians , including confederate gen. robert e. lee , insisted that of course virginia had come first ! at the outbreak of the american revolution , the old dominion was already a century and a half old . generations of lees had helped govern virginia long before the united states was born . but if lee was , first and always , a virginian , lincoln was an american . his father came from virginia , his grandfather hailed from pennsylvania , and before that , the family had probably lived in new england . abe himself had been born in kentucky and had moved as a boy to indiana , and later , as a young man , to illinois . these latter two midwestern states had undeniably been formed by the union itself . these places had begun as federal territory -- the common inheritance of all americans -- and it was the federal government that had indeed brought these new states to life . when young abe moved to indiana , it was just becoming a state , thanks to federal governmental action . it was a wise set of federal policies -- proper land surveys and a commitment to public education -- that had drawn the lincolns and countless other kentuckians to leave the bluegrass state for a brighter future in the midwest . retracing lincoln 's assassination 150 years later . that brighter future also involved freedom from slavery . the old northwest had always been free soil , as provided for by a northwest ordinance that predated the u.s. constitution . the words of the 13th amendment -- the only constitutional amendment that lincoln would live to sign -- promised to end slavery everywhere in america and did so by borrowing verbatim from article 6 of the northwest ordinance . true , geography is not inexorable destiny . many other midwesterners in lincoln 's era embraced slavery and secession . hugo black , the supreme court justice who did the most to make lincoln 's constitutional vision a reality over the next century , was born and raised in alabama . but geographic variation has always been a large part of america 's constitutional saga . in the 1860 election that brought him to power , lincoln swept almost all the northern states , but did miserably in the slaveholding south . john wilkes booth , the dastard who ended lincoln 's life 150 years ago this week , was an embittered extremist from a slave state . so was lincoln 's nemesis on the supreme court , chief justice roger taney . taney 's most infamous ruling , the pro-slavery dred scott decision in 1857 , had emerged from a court dominated by the south ; although slave states accounted for less a third of america 's free population , this region held an absolute majority of the seats on the court . remembering lincoln 's murder . in our era , given the fact that republican appointees have held a majority of the court for the last 40 years , the court has been rather moderate . much of this moderation has come courtesy of northern republicans on the court -- most notably , minnesota 's harry blackmun , illinois ' john paul stevens , and new hampshire 's david souter . all nine of the current justices learned their law in liberal new england , at harvard or yale , and the republican appointee most attentive to gay rights , anthony kennedy , grew up in northern california , a corner of the country renowned for its respect for alternative lifestyles . which takes us back to lincoln . when anthony kennedy was a lad in california 's state capital , the governor , a friend of the kennedy family , was a lincoln republican named earl warren -- a man who would later author the court 's iconic opinion in brown v. board of education , vindicating the constitutional amendments enshrined by lincoln and his allies . today , both parties at their best claim lincoln . jeb bush aims to appeal to the better angels of our nature and rand paul is a kentuckian who professes interest in racial outreach . hillary clinton was born an illinois republican . and the leader of her adopted political party -- who also happens to be president -- is a lanky and brainy lawyer from illinois who knows how to give a good speech , and who swept to power in 2008 by recreating lincoln 's geographic coalition , winning every state within a four-hour drive of chicago . in the largest sense , then , all americans , of both parties and all regions -- whether or not they have ever set foot in illinois -- are living in the land of lincoln .U\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' twenty-nine elephants currently live here , and 13 more will join the group by 2018 , after ringling bros. decided this year to stop using elephants in its traveling circus . `` this was a decision that our family had discussed for quite some time , '' said feld , chairman and ceo of feld entertainment , the company that owns ringling bros. and barnum & bailey . the change comes after years of repeated criticism and lawsuits by animal rights groups . the ultimate decision to phase out the elephants , feld said , is the result of the different laws regulating the use of the animals in each of the 115 cities the circus visits every year . `` you ca n't operate any business , much less with animals , if you do n't have consistency from city to city , '' feld said . `` it 's a definite expense to be in litigation and to be fighting legislation , and there is a saying and it 's been around for a long time : ` you ca n't fight city hall . ' and we found that to be the case in this situation . '' the circus business has been a part of the feld family since 1967 , when irvin feld purchased ringling bros. and barnum & bailey . when irvin died in 1984 , his son , kenneth , took over . `` this is a whole family affair , '' he said . `` it 's a family affair for our family but also for all the elephants . '' when the center opened 20 years ago , it housed fewer than 10 elephants . `` it was a place for elephants to retire , '' feld said . today , the center houses elephants of all ages . `` we have lots of different elephants , meaning males and females , youth elephants , older elephants , so it is a great place to study behavior , '' he said . the center is also focused on breeding the animals . wendy kiso , a research and conservation scientist , spends her days at an onsite lab , trying to figure out how to keep the species from going extinct . part of her lab includes several tanks that `` cryo-preserve '' elephant sperm at negative-196 degrees . `` we process the semen and we extend it in such a way that we can freeze it , '' kiso said . `` this is a genetic resource bank for asian elephants . '' twenty-six elephants have been born here , feld said . mike , the newest pachyderm to join the group , was born at the center 's birthing barn nearly two years ago . `` we have the largest and only sustainable herd of asian elephants in the western hemisphere , '' feld said . caring for the elephants is no small task . trudy williams and her husband , jim , spend their time taking care of the animals ' daily needs . it takes the couple hours to bathe , walk and feed the elephants every day . `` first thing in the morning , we water them , and give them some treats and feed them some hay , '' williams said . each elephant eats about 150 pounds of food a day . twenty-one tons of hay usually lasts only 10 days at the center . exercise is also part of the daily routine , including stretching . `` we just do that a few times on each leg with them , just to give them a good stretch , '' williams said . `` we do some footwork with them . all of our elephants , generally once a month , get a pedicure , just to make sure their feet are in good condition . '' all of this care is n't cheap . `` each elephant costs over $ 65,000 a year , per year , over all the years of their life , '' feld said . `` we 're fortunate we 're for profit . we do make a profit and we 're a privately owned family business , and so we 've made a decision we want to devote a lot of resources here . '' it 's a price feld said he 's willing to pay to keep this species -- some varieties of which in asia and africa are endangered -- alive for generations to come . `` i always say , it 's sort of like jurassic park with a happy ending , '' feld said . `` we knew that if we did n't do something , maybe my grandchildren would never have the opportunity to see these incredible animals .

'' now all eyes will be on next week 's clash between arsenal and chelsea which will likely decide the title . `` they have the games in hand , '' said wenger , playing down his club 's title aspirations . `` but we 'll keep going and that 's why the win was so important for us today . '' relegation dogfight . meanwhile it was a good day for teams at the bottom of the league . aston villa continued their good form since appointing coach tim sherwood with a 1-0 victory over tottenham , who fired sherwood last season . belgian international christian benteke scored the only goal of the game , his eighth in six matches , to secure a vital three points to give the midlands club breathing space . another midlands club looking over their shoulder is west brom , who conceded an injury time goal to lose 3-2 against bottom club leicester city . but it was an awful day for sunderland 's former dutch international coach dick advocaat , who saw his team lose 4-1 at home against form team crystal palace . democratic republic of congo international yannick bolasie scored crystal palace 's first ever hat trick in the premier league to secure an easy victory .a\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xab!-lrb- billboard -rrb- from channing tatum twerking for jennifer lopez to host amy schumer 's archery fail , there were plenty of highlights and misfires from the 2015 mtv movie awards . 2015 mtv movie awards : see the full winners list . here are the jokes , performances and moments that hit the target and the ones and missed it . best moments . amy schumer 's opener : from a `` boyhood '' / hpv joke to nearly flashing j.k. simmons to her run-in with a cancer support group , schumer 's opening video segment was as reliably hilarious and inventive as her comedy central show -lrb- which ca n't come back on tv soon enough -rrb- . plus , her monologue killed : `` half of you know who i am , half of you think i 'm meghan trainor . '' channing tatum doing his thing : when the cast of `` magic mike xxl '' presented j.lo with the scared as shit performance award , she asked them exactly what we were all thinking : `` why are n't you dancing ? '' channing tatum obliged , popping a twerk -lrb- in a suit -rrb- onstage in front of lopez . `` your turn , '' he told her . sadly , she did not oblige . amy schumer takes on hillary clinton , zayn malik and more in monologue . rebel wilson 's censored moment : introducing an exclusive clip from `` pitch perfect 2 '' as an `` exclusive clit '' was easily the funniest non-schumer joke of the entire night . even her castmates seemed shocked when she slipped it in . fall out boy meets fetty wap : `` centuries '' did n't need a rap breakdown , nor did `` trap queen '' need a punk-rock edge . but did it sound killer on both counts ? hell yeah . fetty with an electric guitar is something that needs to happen again . charli xcx , ty dolla $ ign & tinashe : there 's a reason charli gets invited to every mtv awards show : she attacks a pop song with the abandon of a rock 'n' roll tidal wave . `` drop that kitty '' was tinashe 's time to shine , though . it 's only a shame she got about 30 seconds to command the stage . kiss cam : amy schumer sensuously kissing amber rose just before a commercial break ? well played , amy . kevin hart 's comedic genius award : while kimmel 's intro jokes were a little one-note -lrb- we get it , kevin is short -rrb- , it was pretty adorable that hart brought his kids onstage to accept his golden popcorn . as his son held it , you realized the award was bigger than the kid 's head . mtv movie awards : see all the photos . robert downey jr. accepting generation award : his speech was fine -lrb- kudos for the `` keep your nose clean '' quip -rrb- , but his avengers castmates taking a knee while he accepted his award was just perfect . misfires . archery fail : schumer 's bow-and-arrow misfire was a literal misfire . it was n't a big deal , but the fact that it ruined an entire gag -lrb- with jimmy kimmel pretending to get shot in the chest -rrb- was naturally awkward . of course , schumer poked fun at herself almost immediately . `` gone girl '' joke : `` how good was gone girl ? it 's the story of what one crazed white woman -- or every latina -- does when a man cheats on them , '' schumer joked . it was n't awful , just kinda off . mtv immediately cut to j.lo laughing like `` ummm , ok '' -- which is an accurate response . vin diesel sings ` furious 7 ' paul walker tribute song at mtv movie awards . shailene woodley speech : woodley definitely marches to the beat of her own drum , which is part of her appeal . but halfway through her trailblazer award acceptance speech , the neo-hippie charm wore off , leaving most people wondering what she was trying to say . one of those wondering where she was going was woodley herself , who wrapped up her speech by admitting it had totally gotten away from her . zac efron and dave franco : was the punchline for their whole shtick really just efron grabbing franco 's balls ? yes . apparently , a man touching another man 's junk is still comedy gold in 2015 . dwayne johnson : the rock shouting into the camera about 2014 's movie highlights was totally unnecessary . at this point , mtv has to realize we 've heard jokes about `` american sniper '' , `` gone girl '' , `` boyhood '' and `` whiplash '' for almost a year now , and we 're all ready to move on . but god bless the rock for giving it his all .\\x9e\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' john and cynthia lennon were married for six years , from 1962 to 1968 . the pair met at art school , where cynthia studied to be an illustrator and john practiced painting -- in between concerts with a band that would become the beatles . `` when we were at art college , i think he was more interested in the music than he was in the art , '' she told classicbands.com . cynthia lennon , born cynthia powell in 1939 , was a stabilizing force for the young john , who lost his mother when he was a teenager and was raised by his aunt mimi . `` john was always insecure , '' she said in a 2005 interview , having lost his mother at a young age . but his humor -- and his wildness -- were attractive , she told classicbands.com . `` he was a rebel . he was outrageous . that was something i had n't experienced before the age that i was , which was about 16 or 17 . i 'd had quite a normal , straightforward life , '' she said . `` i was just instantly attracted to him . '' the two married in 1962 , just as the beatles were making their rise . their son , julian , was born april 8 , 1963 . lennon 's sometimes-brittle personality and his overwhelming fame became a challenge for cynthia . during her pregnancy , `` i was not supposed to be known or heard about . in the wisdom , or lack of wisdom , anything to do with somebody becoming famous , male , was not supposed to be married or have -lrb- a -rrb- girlfriend . '' she was threatened by fans and occasionally in danger of being left behind in the band 's whirlwind ; when the group traveled to bangor , wales , to meet with the maharishi in 1967 , cynthia was caught in a scrum and could n't make the train in time . she was also there on the 1965 night george harrison , patti boyd and lennon were dosed with lsd -- an experience she disliked -- and traveled to india with the band in early 1968 . the couple divorced in 1968 , by which time john was seeing yoko ono . cynthia lennon married three more times after john and wrote two books about her marriage to the beatle , `` a twist of lennon '' and `` john . '' she had no contact with the surviving members of the band until meeting up at the 2006 las vegas premiere of `` the beatles love . '' for all the difficulties and disappointments -- she described julian , for whom she wrote `` john , '' as `` very scarred by life '' -- she acknowledged that the whirlwind could also be enthralling . `` the whole situation changed my life completely . god knows where i would 've been ended up . i probably would 've been a schoolteacher with about three or four children in a boring situation , '' she told classicbands.com . `` i 've had the most amazing life , a wonderful life .

      "b\"\\x8dA-lrb- cnn -rrb- ten years ago , a prosecutor in centre county , pennsylvania , took a day off work and vanished . since then , the case of ray gricar has become one of the most intriguing and talked about missing persons stories in the country . investigators have taken dives to the bottom of lakes , dug up a grave , chased more than 300 reported sightings from arizona to north carolina , dropped fliers over slovenia , consulted a psychic , interviewed a member of the hell 's angels and enlisted nasa technology . but no one has been able to find the veteran district attorney , who was 59 when he disappeared . when he went missing that friday morning on april 15 , 2005 , he left behind a live-in girlfriend , a beautiful and successful daughter and a bank account that was supposed to fund a fast-approaching retirement . his red mini cooper was found abandoned near a bridge on the susquehanna river about 55 miles away from his home . months later his county-issued laptop and hard drive were found -- separately -- on the banks of the river , too damaged to read . as far as hard evidence goes , that 's about all police have . the best lead they got was the sighting of a woman who has not been identified , and information that he had searched online for ways to destroy a hard drive . what 's left is theory , speculation and a case that 's been cold almost from the beginning . `` when a district attorney goes missing , you know , it 's pretty big . it 's going to catch people 's attention . a lot of people do n't have a large footprint . this guy had influential friends , he was well known , '' said todd matthews , director of communications and case management for the national missing and unidentified person system , or namus . from the start , investigators have considered three possibilities : gricar committed suicide , fell victim to foul play or deliberately walked away . the prevailing theories have been suicide or walk-away , especially since 2009 , when a search of his google history on his home computer found that someone had been searching `` how to fry a hard drive '' and `` water damage to a notebook computer . '' gricar , a private and quiet man , was spotted with a woman who was not his girlfriend the day he went missing , and cigarette ash was found near his car , even though he was not a smoker . friends and colleagues recalled him being distant in the weeks that led up to his disappearance , and recounted his fascination with another law enforcement official from ohio who vanished in 1985 . matthews said that namus has compared gricar 's dna to unidentified bodies nine times since the database became available in 2009 , but so far , none has been a match . `` even if he chose to make himself go missing , it sounds like something was terribly wrong that caused a drastic change in his life . there 's something wrong if he 's googled how to fry a hard drive . did he google it ? did someone else google it ? was he threatened ? did he do something and is trying to cover it up ? it 's not a normal thing to google that . '' matt rickard , the former investigator who had been in charge of the investigation for several years , thinks that hard drive is the key to cracking the case . he said he 's still holding out hope that someday technology will allow investigators to recover the damaged data . `` i think there is something out there . whether it 's evidence or a person , there 's something that could lead us to something , '' he said . `` in all honesty , somebody destroyed the hard drive and there was a reason . we have very few solid leads and the biggest one could be contained on that hard drive . '' in 2011 , when former penn state defensive coordinator jerry sandusky was arrested and charged with sexually abusing boys , it was revealed that it was gricar who decided not to charge sandusky when the first victim came forward in 1998 . gricar cited a lack of evidence . the intrigue already simmering in gricar 's case exploded . sleuths desperately tried to find a link between the two cases , but investigators said there was no evidence that gricar 's disappearance had anything to do with sandusky 's crimes . but some have stuck to the homicide theory , suggesting that gricar was an enemy of mob-like gangs in central pennsylvania who were upset at his drug and corruption prosecutions . cyril wecht , a forensic pathologist , said he considered writing a book about gricar , his ties to the sandusky case , and whether it led to suicide . but , wecht said , he abandoned the book idea when it became clear there was not enough evidence . `` i do n't think it 's a great stretch , '' wecht said . `` he was one of those guys with a very strong sense of justice and professional discipline and in light of what evolved and came to be disclosed -- i speak as a forensic pathologist who 's done so many suicides over the years and what can bring someone to that point . it 's pure conjecture , not based on any factual knowledge . '' plus , wecht said , if it was a suicide , `` i do n't understand how they never recovered the body . '' bob buehner , a former district attorney in montour county , pennsylvania , who was gricar 's friend , has never accepted a suicide or walk-away theory . he believes his colleague was killed . buehner has doubts that , 10 years later , state police can recover from what he considers a bungled start to the case . `` it did n't seem like there was any overall game plan that made sense in terms of a systematic investigation , '' buehner said . `` one of the things i 'd asked them to do from the first couple weeks is now impossible to do -- to do a hotel-motel canvas looking for the mystery woman seen with ray and then match the names with photo ids which police have access to . '' buehner said those records are now gone and his faith in finding gricar is dwindling . `` i give it a 50-50 at best and only because i 'm an optimist and i hope that 's what will happen , '' he said . `` as a pessimist , maybe 1 in 10 that we 'll find him . '' despite fresh eyes on the investigation when it was handed over to state authorities last year , the mystery woman has not been found . `` pennsylvania state police continue to chase down new leads and take a fresh look at old leads and we continue to hold out hope that something will break out in this case , '' said centre county 's district attorney stacy parks miller . `` everybody , regardless of what position they held , deserves this kind of attention . in any missing persons case , he 's not the only one , we feel discouraged when we ca n't answer the questions for the family , but it does n't change our dedication to the case . '' the case has gotten significant attention on the national level , appearing on several true-crime television shows , including hln 's `` nancy grace . '' so it was strange to many in pennsylvania that for years a case with such a high profile would be handled by the tiny bellefonte police department , where one investigator was assigned to juggle gricar 's case along with several more . in 2014 , the state police took over , but that was nine years after gricar went missing and two years after he had been declared legally dead . sources close to the investigation told cnn the case , as state police received it , was disorganized and porous . evidence had been compromised in storage . reports were missing . evidence had been collecting dust in file cabinets . there was never a forensic audit of his finances . today , some of gricar 's friends believe the case is damaged beyond repair . they have lost faith that there will ever be any answers . when asked if she thought things might change when state police got the case , barbara gray , his ex-wife and the mother of his daughter lara , said no . `` the evidence is the same , '' she said . lara declined to comment , and investigators said they 've had trouble reaching her . `` there is always a remote possibility that we might never have an answer , '' said lt. james emigh , who leads the investigation for the pennsylvania state police after inheriting it last year . `` we still hold out hope , and the state police will however continue to diligently follow up every possible lead and attempt to bring closure to the family and friends of ray .

'' investigators ' efforts to defend bates and the other deputies involved in the arrest have sparked a mounting chorus of criticism online . harris ' relatives are demanding an independent investigation of what they call unjustified brutality . they 're also questioning why the 73-year-old bates -- the ceo of an insurance company who volunteers as a certified reserve deputy -- was on the scene in such a sensitive and high-risk sting operation . daniel smolen , an attorney representing the harris family , said bates paid big money to play a cop in his spare time . bates , who was a police officer for a year in the 1960s , had been a reserve deputy since 2008 , with 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience , according to the sheriff 's office . he was also a frequent contributor to the tulsa county sheriff 's office , including $ 2,500 to the re-election of sheriff stanley glanz . the sheriff 's office has said that bates had law enforcement certification , but smolen said he has not seen any field training records . `` we 're holding up all right at this point , '' andre harris said . `` we 're putting our faith in god that justice will be served , and we can get some closure in this situation . '' how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? in a statement released tuesday , eric harris ' family members said they know there are many good deputies working in tulsa county . `` however , the treatment of eric of april 2 clearly shows that there is a deep-seated problem within the tcso , '' the statement said . the family said that the sheriff has not apologized and that the department has not shown remorse or indication it will change its policies . cnn 's jason morris and ed lavandera contributed to this report .\\xd5\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' he concluded , `` we 're in unchartered territory here . '' mcgurk just returned from an urgent summit of coalition nations held in jordan . last week , canada became the latest nation to conduct airstrikes against isis over syria . the united states now lists 62 countries in the coalition . as the u.s.-led coalition has focused attention on iraq and syria , isis has expanded its reach to libya , egypt and yemen , often with existing extremist groups pledging allegiance to the militants . mcgurk did not rule out expanding u.s. military action beyond iraq and syria to combat the increasing regional threat . `` we have a lot of tools to protect ourselves and our national security interests , some of which are military tools , '' he said . `` of course we apply those tools when the president determines and our chain of command makes the recommendation that that is the right thing to do . '' the united states has also been stepping up efforts to involve sunni groups in the fight against isis . to date , that involvement has been extremely limited as sunni tribes see shiite militias , many with horrendous human rights records , take the lead . but mcgurk said that iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi is making progress getting sunni tribes to support a planned iraqi offensive against isis in anbar province in the coming weeks . he stressed the importance of working with al-abadi , noting that the iraqi leader was in anbar province last week handing out more than 1,000 ak-47s to tribal fighters who are going to join the iraqi security forces . `` we are helping to enable and train -lrb- them -rrb- as they begin to go on the offensive over the coming weeks and months in anbar , '' mcgurk said . `` they put out this very perverse , twisted vision , and it 's very attractive to a lot of young men around the world , '' he acknowledged . `` but in fact , what the foreign fighters are finding in syria and iraq is that they 're more likely to get killed in iraq and syria , and in fact , instead of getting a slave bride as isis leaders promise them , they 're more likely to get killed by a female peshmerga fighter in the streets of kobani . '' that bottom line , he assessed , could turn the tide : `` the foreign fighters are learning the reality of what it 's like when they go to join this twisted version of a caliphate , and i think we 're going to see those networks begin to dry up .

      "b\"\\xe5\\x19duhok , iraqi kurdistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- in the canvas expanse of the shariya refugee camp , thousands of yazidis live within hearing distance of one of iraqi kurdistan 's frontlines with isis . the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of sinjar and fled the isis assault there back in august . but not everyone escaped . isis took thousands of yazidis captive . men faced a choice -- convert to islam or be shot . but the islamist militants separated the young women and girls to be sold as sex slaves . in its fourth edition of `` dabiq , '' the isis online magazine , an article titled `` the revival of slavery before the hour , '' outlines the group 's twisted justification and guidelines for the enslavement of the yazidis . `` one should remember that enslaving the families of the kuffar -lrb- infidels -rrb- and taking their women as concubines is a firmly established aspect of shariah , '' the article reads . we 're told that women who have just given birth or are breastfeeding are considered impure and can not be taken as sexual slaves -- but hanan , 19 , was neither of those things . `` they separated all of us , '' she says . `` they dragged us away by our hair . they took married women , young ones . the youngest with us was just 10 . we were all crying . `` they said we are going to marry you off , you will forget your family . '' isis : enslaving , having sex with ` unbelieving ' women , girls is ok . for the first week , hanan was held with 50 others , regularly beaten and threatened with torture , and fed just a bowl of rice . the group was then taken to a three story building in mosul she described as a sex slave warehouse , where hundreds of girls and women were held . `` they would line about 50 of us up at a time , in rows of 10 . they would say do n't move , do n't cry or we will beat you . the men would come in and describe the kind of girl they wanted and then they would pick and choose as they pleased , '' she recalls . she was eventually chosen , part of a group of 25 . from that group hanan was separated into a smaller group of seven and taken into a house in a village . ` treated like cattle ' : yazidi women sold , raped , enslaved by isis . two isis fighters guarded the door and ordered the girls to clean and bathe themselves . `` they brought in a yazidi girl who had been with them for two months . she was wearing the black niqab . they said to us we are going to do to you what we did to her , '' hanan says . `` the girl spoke to us in kurdish and said they beat me , they cuffed me and raped me . '' hanan and the others decided they had to try to escape . that night they crawled out the bedroom window . `` the fourth girl jumped out , i was the fifth . i crawled to the wall and was about to jump over it and then i saw their flashlight , '' she tells me . `` they caught the last two girls . '' they ran , and somehow evaded capture . four hours later they were out of isis territory . `` if i just see someone with a beard i start shaking , '' hanan says . now physically free but mentally still captive , hanan remains tormented -- like so many others , by what she has been through and what those still with isis are being forced to endure -- a fate worse than death . fleeing isis -- a yazidi family 's tale .\\xe2\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xed(lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- a day after winning nigeria 's presidency , muhammadu buhari told cnn 's christiane amanpour that he plans to aggressively fight corruption that has long plagued nigeria and go after the root of the nation 's unrest . buhari said he 'll `` rapidly give attention '' to curbing violence in the northeast part of nigeria , where the terrorist group boko haram operates . by cooperating with neighboring nations chad , cameroon and niger , he said his administration is confident it will be able to thwart criminals and others contributing to nigeria 's instability . for the first time in nigeria 's history , the opposition defeated the ruling party in democratic elections . buhari defeated incumbent goodluck jonathan by about 2 million votes , according to nigeria 's independent national electoral commission . the win comes after a long history of military rule , coups and botched attempts at democracy in africa 's most populous nation . in an exclusive live interview from abuja , buhari told amanpour he was not concerned about reconciling the nation after a divisive campaign . he said now that he has been elected he will turn his focus to boko haram and `` plug holes '' in the `` corruption infrastructure '' in the country . `` a new day and a new nigeria are upon us , '' buhari said after his win tuesday . `` the victory is yours , and the glory is that of our nation . '' earlier , jonathan phoned buhari to concede defeat . the outgoing president also offered a written statement to his nation . `` i thank all nigerians once again for the great opportunity i was given to lead this country , and assure you that i will continue to do my best at the helm of national affairs until the end of my tenure , '' jonathan said . `` i promised the country free and fair elections . i have kept my word . '' buhari , 72 , will be sworn in on may 29 . he will take the helm at a critical time , as nigeria grapples with boko haram , serious economic woes and corruption . this is n't buhari 's first time leading nigeria , but it 's his first time in nearly 30 years . a military coup brought buhari to power in late 1983 , closing a brief period of popular rule by shehu shagari . but buhari himself was ousted by another military coup in august 1985 . read more : who is nigeria 's muhammadu buhari ? his presidential win is the result of his fourth attempt to lead the country since he was ousted 30 years ago . buhari is a sunni muslim from nigeria 's poorer north , while jonathan comes from a christian and animist south that is rich with oil . buhari praised voters for exercising their right peacefully . `` your vote affirms that you believe nigeria 's future can be better than what it is today , '' he said in his statement . `` you voted for change , and now change has come . '' buhari campaigned as a born-again democrat to allay fears about his strict military regime . he stressed that nigeria 's security needs to be the next government 's focus . his campaign was also fiercely anti-corruption . he ran under the slogan of `` new broom , '' and his supporters were often pictured holding brooms in the lead-up to the vote . despite years of democracy , analysts say , corruption has hindered nigeria from building a stable economy . one of buhari 's biggest challenges will be boko haram , which has been terrorizing nigeria as it tries to institute a strict version of sharia law in the country . in the past few years , the terror group has bombed churches and mosques , killed hundreds of people and kidnapped more than 200 teenage girls from a boarding school . even the presidential vote had to be postponed because of the radical militants . the election was originally scheduled for february 14 , but was delayed six weeks because the military needed more time to secure areas controlled by boko haram . yet the violence persisted . on saturday , residents in the northeastern state of gombe said at least 11 people were killed in attacks at polling stations , apparently by boko haram extremists . jonathan had been criticized for not doing enough to combat boko haram . before the election , african affairs analyst ayo johnson said the vote would come down to who could make nigeria feel safe . `` many nigerians will not forget -lrb- buhari -rrb- was a military leader during a dictatorship , '' johnson said . `` or maybe they will feel that they need a military leader to address fundamental problems such as terrorism . '' boko haram is n't the only obstacle facing the new president . the economy is another major issue . nigeria overtook south africa last year as the region 's largest economy . nigeria is one of africa 's largest oil producers and is a major supplier of crude oil to the united states . it also hosts many international oil companies and workers . but many complain that the country 's vast wealth from oil exports does n't trickle down to the average citizen . as many as 70 % of nigerians live below the poverty line , surviving on less than a dollar a day . christian purefoy reported from lagos ; holly yan reported and wrote from atlanta . cnn 's stephanie busari , faith karimi and susannah cullinane contributed to this report .\\x03\\n\"\n",

'' the document makes clear that the campaign will try to avoid mistakes that plagued clinton 's failed 2008 run . many of the `` guiding principles '' in the memo mention issues that sunk clinton 's first campaign . the document , according to the source , includes the ideas from mook , along with a wide array of clinton 's soon-to-be staffers and advisers . the memo maintains that the campaign must remain humble , disciplined and united , something voters in iowa and others states have said clinton did not do in 2008 . `` this campaign is not about hillary clinton and not about us , '' reads the document that was obtained by cnn . in the section about the campaign 's guiding principles , the document reads , `` we are humble : we take nothing for granted , we are never afraid to lose , we always outcompete and fight for every vote we can win . we know this campaign will be won on the ground , in states . '' it also calls on campaign staffers to remain `` disciplined '' and `` open to a diverse range of views . '' `` when we disagree , it 's never personal . once a decision is made , we execute it -- together , '' reads the memo . `` we know there will be tough days , but we will bounce back and get back to work . '' the document also appears to telegraph the name to clinton 's campaign : `` hillary for america . '' clinton is planning to launch her presidential candidacy on sunday through a video message on social media , according to democratic sources . shortly after her announcement , clinton will travel iowa and new hampshire , critical early caucus primary and caucus states .h\\x17\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb3,west of baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- the call from faleh essawi , the deputy chief of the provincial council , who we were supposed to be meeting up with , came just as we were about to hit the bridge -- the only safe route from baghdad to neighboring anbar province . `` isis has taken the east of the city , it 's not accessible , '' he says , sounding frantic , rapidly rattling off the neighborhoods and areas isis fighters had just stormed into . moments later , we see the impact : an endless stream of humanity , shell shocked , and exhausted . parents cradle babies in blankets , some struggle under the weight of their belongings , some carry small plastic bags , while others nothing but the children clutching at their hands . cars are not permitted to cross this bridge across the euphrates . the government feels that restricting vehicles will decrease the likelihood of explosives making their way into iraq 's capital . those too young or too tired to walk pile into metal carts pushed by boys or young men , normally used to carry produce to markets . an elderly woman sits in one , a child in her arms , a worn down plastic doll in her hand . many do n't want to talk , at least not for long . what they just went through is too raw , too painful . one man we encounter describes how isis fighters commandeered his house . `` we heard clashes in the early morning , and we could n't see the security forces anywhere , '' he recalls . `` we saw the isis fighters , they just came into the house , they did n't say a word . they just sent a sniper to the roof . i grabbed my children and ran . '' his wife bursts into tears , prompting him to apologize for not being able to talk anymore -- they just want to keep going . another older woman , sitting in one of the carts surrounded by her grandchildren , starts sobbing the moment we approach her . `` they took our homes and kicked us out , '' she cries . over the weekend isis moved into towns just to the north of ramadi , which lies 68 miles -lrb- 110km -rrb- west of baghdad , sending thousands fleeing on foot into the city . isis had already blocked off access from the south months ago , and the west was contested territory . the east , until now , was not just a relatively safe zone but the only viable entrance and exit . at a hospital in amriyat al-falluja , about a 15-minute drive away , a wounded local fighter winces in pain . he was shot by a sniper in ramadi that morning as isis fighters advanced -- the bullet barely missed his heart . `` we had been warning we could see their movements , '' he tells us . `` but we just did n't have the force to hold them off . we did n't leave a single person we did n't call and ask for back up . '' but none came . hours after our morning conversation we speak to essawi again by phone . `` security is collapsing in the city , '' he screams . `` this is what we warned baghdad would happen . where is baghdad ? where is al-abadi ? `` just god knows if we will survive this , '' he says and hangs up . amriyat al-falluja regularly comes under attack from rockets and mortars from isis positions nearby . the hospital 's fa\\xc3\\xa7ade is scarred by shrapnel . the wards are full of people injured during these attacks . fifteen-year-old mustafa ahmed has bandages on his neck , leg , and other parts of his body . `` a mortar fell on our street , one of my neighbors was wounded , '' he explains . `` we went out to help him and the second one fell on us . '' his friend died , he says . in the next room amal ahmed speaks softly . `` i was in the garden and a rocket hit and the shrapnel sliced me open , '' she says , as tears roll down her face . `` something fell out of me and i grabbed it and i put it back in and i lay down . '' she starts to cry harder . her husband was killed by u.s. forces in fallujah -- another city in anbar -- in 2003 . her children have all moved away except her youngest , who broke his arm in the same attack . `` when i see the situation i do n't have hope , it 's just getting worse . '' a few moments later , we hear two massive explosions from another of the hospital 's buildings . they think it 's an isis rocket or mortar attack so we take cover along with the iraqi forces we are with in the hallway , away from the windows . more explosions go off in the distance . then another actually shakes our building . `` anyone want tea ? '' one of the policemen with us asks , laughing as he pours . `` this happens all the time , we 're used to it . '' the police chief , major aref al-janabi , radios to his men to respond . al-janabi , like so many others , is frustrated with the lack of support from baghdad . earlier , he had taken us to the front lines , a long berm that stretches along the northern and western parts of the town that is dotted with fighting positions . he says he regularly provides the joint command center with coordinates for isis positions , but so far there have been no significant air strikes or reinforcements . more explosions follow in the distance . we 're quickly moved out and leave the town , heading back towards the bridge and the long , snaking lines of refugees . an ambulance passes us , trying to force its way through the crowds . the swell of people fleeing has grown considerably in the last hours -- not surprising given essawi 's dire assessment and warning . `` ramadi is under siege from all sides , '' he 'd told us earlier , anger mixed with an air of resignation . `` i consider the city to have fallen . '' he claimed that 150,000 have fled , scoffing at statements from iraqi officials in baghdad that reinforcements have been sent to ramadi . he has yet to see them .\\x9d\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe27-lrb- cnn -rrb- the white house insists it does n't need congressional approval for the iran nuclear deal announced this month . but while historical precedent suggests the president might indeed have the authority to move forward without congress , the obama administration should probably learn another lesson from history : getting congress ' signature might be worth the effort . true , the fight for congressional approval would be politically bruising and consume a huge amount of energy . but it would still be a mistake to move forward with the deal as an executive-based agreement rather than obtaining the consent of the legislative branch -- a diplomatic breakthrough of this magnitude would be far more enduring with the imprimatur of congress . the president and his advisers have avoided using the term `` treaty , '' instead explaining that it would be a `` nonbinding agreement . '' according to secretary of state john kerry : `` we 've been very clear from the beginning . we 're not negotiating a ` legally binding plan . ' we 're negotiating a plan that will have in it a capacity for enforcement . '' on `` meet the press , '' kerry said , `` what we 're looking for is not to have congress interfere with our ability , inappropriately , by stepping on the prerogatives of the executive department of the president . '' there is a big legal argument that will play out over these definitional issues , with the potential for court challenges . but outside of the legal debate , there are also significant political questions , and those are a different beast altogether . for a start , there is growing pressure on capitol hill -- from members of both parties -- to pass legislation that would give congress the right to review the deal and make a decision about lifting sanctions . on tuesday , a deal was reached on legislation proposed by senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker that would require president barack obama to submit the final deal to congress , giving it 52 days to review and approve the agreement . corker told msnbc on tuesday that negotiators had reached a `` bipartisan agreement that keeps the congressional review process absolutely intact , full of integrity . '' what 's in the iran bill and why all the fuss ? there is good reason for obama to avoid calling this a treaty . after all , given the contentious political environment on capitol hill , where legislators struggle to pass even a routine budget , the notion that they would move on a treaty of this importance seems dubious at best . but there is also a history of congress causing significant trouble for important international treaties . in the late 1970s , for example , president jimmy carter tried to obtain consent for the salt ii treaties , but conservatives argued the agreement was evidence that carter was weak on defense . carter pushed for the treaties as essential to international peace but to no avail . after iranians took american hostages and the soviets invaded afghanistan , the treaties died in the senate . yet there are other examples where even in a contentious congressional environment , presidents successfully pushed for the ratification of treaties that they knew would cost them important political capital , and even once the white house exited the struggle bruised and battered , the historic treaties endured . top gop , dem senators say iran compromise reached . this was the case with another treaty that carter asked the senate to ratify : the panama canal treaties of 1978 . carter decided that turning authority of the canal over to panama was essential to regional peace and stability . he knew this would be tough sell , and tennessee republican howard baker for his part predicted he would n't even get 20 votes as conservative groups coordinated their campaign through the committee to save the panama canal and the emergency coalition to save the panama canal . indeed , they dispatched speakers to warn that the deal would give the soviets a foothold in the region . however , carter countered aggressively , both on a personal level -- helping secure the vote of sen. richard stone of florida by sending a personal letter to the senator , dispatching experts to florida to answer the questions of constituents and addressing audiences through state-of-the-art telephone hookups . in the end , the senate ratified the treaties by one vote more than the required two-thirds majority , although carter also paid a political price after energizing the right during the fight . president ronald reagan faced a similar challenge . toward the end of his presidency , he reached a historic breakthrough on intercontinental ballistic missiles with the soviet union . yet despite excitement in the white house and across the nation about soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's visit to washington in december 1987 , many conservatives blasted the decision , arguing that reagan had betrayed the conservative cause . during a meeting at the white house , eight republican senators who opposed the treaty shared their feelings with reagan . sen. malcolm wallop of wyoming , one of reagan 's closest allies , said : `` the soviets have broken most every treaty they have ever signed . ... how do we assure compliance with the new treaty ? '' right-wing organizations , meanwhile , compared reagan with neville chamberlain . reagan responded with an aggressive effort to halt their rebellion . in a hearing on the treaty , secretary of state george shultz attacked north carolina republican jesse helms , who had accused reagan of `` confusion , misstatements and ... even misrepresentation . '' he met with republicans , spoke with reporters and lobbied the public to endorse the deal . despite their protests , most republicans eventually came around . on may 27 , 1988 , the senate ratified the treaty 93-5 . helms , one of the few to vote against the treaty , admitted they were `` licked . '' and the treaty , which marked the beginning of the end for the cold war , has endured . the reality is that the signature of congress is still worth a lot in american politics -- the ratification process brings legitimacy to a major and controversial agreement and makes it much more difficult for opponents to attack in the future as some power grab by a president . congressional support also makes the strength of the treaty greater in the eyes of leaders overseas . all this will be true with iran , especially as many members of obama 's own party are leery about the agreement . ultimately , the president probably has the right to go his own way with this , and his frustration with congress might create strong incentives for doing so . but in the long term , persuading and pressuring a sufficient number of legislators to sign on to this deal would greatly improve the chances of avoiding a regional war -- and would help prevent iran from becoming a nuclear power . the good news is that there have been some statements from the white house that offer hope it recognizes the centrality of congress in a solid deal . now it 's time to see if the administration follows through .\\x1e\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' deal is apparently one of those believers , signing hb1 on thursday and opening the door for the use of cannabis oil to treat certain medical conditions . the bill will benefit not only people who suffer from chronic seizure disorders , but it also will allow patients to receive in-state treatment . to obtain a license in georgia , you will need to have a specific covered condition , such as acute seizures . `` for the families enduring separation and patients suffering pain , the wait is finally over , '' deal said thursday . '' ... now , georgia children and their families may return home while continuing to receive much-needed care . '' for cox , it 's a blessing `` to be able to come back home , and with haleigh 's medicine , it 's done wonders for her -- going from 200-plus seizures a day and on her deathbed to a smiling , happy girl who says words now and looks us in the eye and lets us know she 's in there . '' she added , `` colorado has been good to us , but georgia 's home . georgia 's definitely home . '' with medical marijuana legal in nearly half the states , doctors are increasingly studying what effect the drug has on various ailments . while georgia 's law is specific to a handful of conditions , medical marijuana laws in states such as california permit marijuana use for an array of ailments . but as states rewrite their regulations , federal law remains the same : marijuana is illegal to grow , sell or use for any purpose . under the controlled substances act , marijuana is listed on schedule 1 , meaning it has `` no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse . '' to backers of reform , it presents a catch-22 : marijuana is restricted , in large part , because there is scant research to support medical uses , yet research is difficult to conduct because of tight restrictions .\\x17\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' sandretto said she first visited cuba three years ago and was instantly hooked . `` i stayed and went back and back because it 's a very unique place and people are really beautiful and amazing and with interesting stories , '' she said . gaining entrance to the maze-like solares was a constant negotiation , sandretto said , and plenty of times she was turned away . `` i always try to explain what i do , why i am there , why i am interested in where they live , the aim of my project , '' she said . toting a 30-year-old hasselblad 500cm camera , sandretto found it was a good way to strike up a conversation with her subjects . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` they get curious when see someone going around with a bulky old camera , '' she said . `` i talk a lot . i am italian . i speak spanish , which helps but not a lot because you have to speak ` cuban , ' which is another language . '' her persistence allowed her to capture intimate moments of cubans resting in the sweltering heat , crowding around a communal tv or just going about life despite their disintegrating surroundings . there are no modern appliances or conveniences in her photographs . the people in these solares are n't the fortunate cubans who have relatives visiting from miami with flat-screens and smartphones in tow . instead , there is the sense of time being whittled away -- one game of dominoes or one tv soap opera a time . sandretto said she hopes to continue to document the changes on the island that occur as the united states and cuba work to restore diplomatic relations and an inevitable influx of american visitors arrive . the thawing in relations could even change life in cuba 's solares . `` people want to travel , have access to the internet and improve their economic situation , '' she said . `` i hope that 's what happens .

'' `` tonight , the senate is voting to retire the outdated , inefficiency-rewarding , common sense-defying medicare reimbursement system , '' said sen. ron wyden of oregon , the top democrat on the finance committee just before the final vote . the house approved the same bill overwhelmingly more than two weeks ago and president barack obama is expected to sign it . senate passage came just hours before cuts to physicians would have taken place since the last temporary `` doc fix '' had already expired . some conservative senators , including republican presidential candidate ted cruz of texas , balked at the more than $ 200 billion price of the bill and pushed an amendment to have the costs offset . the bill , `` institutionalizes and expands obamacare policies that harm patients and their doctors while adding roughly half a trillion dollars to our long-term debt within two decades , '' cruz said in a statement . `` any deal should be fully paid for and include significant and structural reforms to medicare . '' but that amendment was defeated , as were several others from each party that came up for votes . earlier , house speaker john boehner of ohio warned the senate not to change the bill . `` unless the senate passes the house-passed ` doc fix , ' significant cuts to physicians ' payments will begin tomorrow , '' boehner said . `` we urge the senate to approve the house-passed bill without delay .

      "b\"\\xbb/-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week 's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in panama : a historic handshake between president barack obama and cuban president raul castro . but this first meeting of obama and castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story . or at least obama is hoping it wo n't be . after all , the president has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits , where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments . the reality is that the united states has been losing ground in this increasingly important region , and obama needs to put on a strong performance in panama at the summit of the americas if the u.s. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends , but who have drifted away as america has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the middle east . unfortunately , america has lost influence in latin america to a hyperactive china , a cunning russia and a troubling iran , all of which have made inroads in the region at washington 's expense . this gathering therefore offers a chance for the u.s. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with latin american and caribbean blood who make their homes in the united states . the foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there . but they need attention , and the panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building . but first : do no harm . large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events , and the u.s. , with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings , knows the importance of dotting the i 's and crossing the t 's . but this has n't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and pr disasters for the u.s. just look at the last summit , held in cartagena , colombia , which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after secret service agents embarrassed the united states by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms , in violation of basic security protocols . they were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee . as a result of all this , the americans looked dumb , incompetent -- and cheap . and back in 2009 , the president -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking , fiery anti-american president of venezuela . the late hugo chavez outplayed the leader of the free world , who had just taken office and was trying to show america 's new `` outstretched hand '' toward the foe of the george w. bush era . the summit hit a depressing low for the obama administration when chavez walked up to obama and , as the cameras clicked , handed the american president a copy of the book `` open veins of latin america , '' which blames the region 's woes on the u.s. and europe . yet the problems in cartagena were n't just symbolic . regional leaders lined up against washington , which had refused to include cuba in the summit , and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless havana was also invited . america was cornered . all this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early clinton years , when the president issued an invitation to `` democratically elected '' heads of state of latin america , which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship . back then , the u.s. had just led the creation of the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region , namely democracy , free trade and economic growth . that 's what it should aim for every time : articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it . can obama manage something similar this time ? true , the president has come armed with his new cuba policy . unfortunately , in an effort to placate critics who say obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists , the white house has miscalculated with venezuela , handing the repressive regime of chavez 's successor , nicolas maduro , a stick with which to beat the u.s. obama has long and rightly ignored maduro 's claims that the u.s. planned to overthrow him . but a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the u.s. , something he will no doubt play that up in panama . all this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with latin americans who already have complicated feelings toward the u.s. over its cold war support for unseemly right-wing dictators , a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing soviet-backed communism from taking hold . but those days are behind us . today , the people want prosperity , they want democracy , and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the united states . too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms : opposition leaders are in prison in venezuela ; a prosecutor who criticized the president was found dead in argentina ; press freedom is under siege in several countries ; and corruption is reaching new highs . all of this suggests that if obama plays his cards right , he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of latin america that their goals are also america 's goals ; that like them , he supports democracy , human rights , the rule of law , full freedom of expression and free elections in every country . the fact that he met with cuban dissidents was welcome , and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with cuba . for the millions in latin america that still live in poverty , these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury . but if obama can show them that the united states is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives , then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake .\\x05\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb5--lrb- cnn -rrb- for lt. colonel john schwemmer , the scenery is all too familiar . this is his sixth tour in iraq , and he 's back doing a job that he 's been tasked with before : training iraqi soldiers . schwemmer and other active u.s. military personnel are on the ground in iraq , whipping often ill-equipped government troops into shape . they 've been here before , but this time , he feels , they 're getting it right . but the u.s. military is n't the only contingent of western forces in the region -- dozens of foreigners , including americans , have volunteered to take the fight to isis . and increasingly , u.s. military training efforts are being supplemented by outside agencies , who are working with kurdish government troops and even militia in iraq and syria . `` many of us do feel that we do have the skills and qualifications that can be used to benefit those in the region , '' said ian bradbury , a canadian former soldier who is training kurdish peshmerga forces in northern iraq . while it is difficult to say how many foreign volunteers are fighting isis , a spokesman for a kurdish militia fighting against them in syria -- known as the ypg -- told the new york times their forces include more than 100 american citizens . u.s. law enforcement officials say it is illegal to join a syrian militia . but some organizations have set up recruitment drives online , featuring applications for foreign fighters complete with checklists of what to bring and advice on bringing body armor across international borders . jordan matson , a 28-year-old former u.s. army soldier from the tiny town of sturtevant , wisconsin , volunteered with the ypg . he told cnn that after much soul searching he realized that he needed to help in the battle against isis ' brutal , expansionist regime . `` i got in contact with the ypg on facebook and prayed about it for probably a month or two and asked , ` is this what i want to do ? ' and eventually , you know , decided to do it . `` all my life i wanted to be a solider ... so i guess this just fits well over here . '' but foreign fighters are n't universally welcomed by those opposing isis . the peshmerga , the military wing of the kurdish regional government -lrb- krg -rrb- that has been one of the most effective counterbalances to isis ' expansion , has said they do n't want or need foreign fighters , according to bradbury . `` the information i 've been getting back is that there 's very little use for -lrb- western fighters -rrb- on the front lines , especially on the krg side -- they have significant numbers of personnel -- it 's a source of kurdish pride for them to rise up in scenarios like this . they more need the development assistance . '' peshmerga spokesman helgurd hekmat also told kurdish news wire rudaw that it was illegal for foreigners to join their ranks . while individual fighters are not always accepted , volunteers working as military trainers are sharing their expertise to support those on the front lines of the fight against isis forces . bradbury set up 1st north american expeditionary forces -lrb- 1st naef -rrb- , a training body which , he says , is currently providing material support and training to the peshmerga , whose name means `` those who face death , '' in northern iraq . `` internal capacity building is by far the solution that you can put into a region that is suffering instability from conflict , '' he told cnn by phone from his base in ottawa , canada . `` increasing their ability to maintain stability over the long term is far better than trying to influx it with a bunch of westerners who are going to leave within a short period of time . '' he was prompted to establish the group after seeing `` fairly significant gaps '' in the support provided by the coalition forces for the kurdish , iraqi regular and militia ranged against isis . the u.s. military is `` confident '' that its support of the forces battling isis on the ground is sufficient . `` we 're confident the u.s. military mission of degrading and ultimately defeating -lrb- isis -rrb- will be found by working through our middle eastern partners and the international community , '' maj. omar villarreal , communication integration planner , u.s. central command communication integration directorate , told cnn . `` the training element of the mission is no different . it relies on direct and comprehensive military cooperation with regional partner nations , who share a mutual interest in promoting security . one of the goals of the train and equip program , is to build the capabilities of the moderate syrian fighters to defend the syrian people . we are confident in our efforts . '' with coalition members keen to distance themselves from calls for western boots on the ground -- and little political appetite from overseas for risking western troops in what many see as a sectarian conflict , bradbury contends that the best-case scenario is exactly the kind of logistical support that organizations like 1st naef are providing . isis is keen to play up religious and sectarian divisions in order to create the perception that they are the sunni protectors of a persecuted underclass , sending non-arab troops into the battlefield -- even in a support role -- could play into that divisive rhetoric . bradbury downplays this risk , saying the threat is there , and is best contained in the region . providing noncombat backing , such as medical , weaponry , logistical and training assistance would appear , he thinks , to be the best way of supporting those kurdish and arab troops on the front . `` regardless of perceptions of any kind of us-against-them scenario , it absolutely is a world-against-isis issue that needs to take place and there definitely needs to be a global response , '' he said .\\x9f\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe09tulsa , oklahoma -lrb- cnn -rrb- amid growing scrutiny over whether a 73-year-old volunteer deputy who killed a suspect during a sting operation was qualified to be policing the streets , a new report raises a troubling allegation . some supervisors at the tulsa county sheriff 's office were told to forge reserve deputy robert bates ' training records , and three who refused were reassigned to less desirable duties , the tulsa world newspaper reported . claims that the volunteer deputy 's records had been falsified emerged `` almost immediately '' from multiple sources after bates killed eric harris on april 2 , reporter dylan goforth said . bates claims he meant to use his taser but accidentally fired his handgun at harris instead . the newspaper 's story does not say who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why . but the orders apparently started years ago , before harris ' death , `` back when -lrb- bates -rrb- was trying to get on as a deputy , '' reporter ziva branstetter told cnn 's `` new day . '' the sheriff 's office denied the allegations in the tulsa world 's report . it also declined a cnn interview to respond to the claims . in an email to cnn , the department 's maj. shannon clark said the lack of named sources in the newspaper 's report leaves him dubious . `` just keep in mind that the tulsa world reporter can not validate her sources and claims anonymity , which leaves us skeptical that her claims are unsubstantiated and deceptive , '' clark wrote . clark brewster , an attorney who represents bates , said the accusations are based on an affidavit from a former sheriff 's office employee who 's now facing a first-degree murder charge . `` i do n't put a lot of stock in that report or the credibility of who would further that report , '' brewster said . shooting casts spotlight on volunteer police programs . sheriff stanley glanz and other sheriff 's officials have repeatedly insisted bates was properly trained . the tulsa county sheriff 's office has released a summary of bates ' training courses only over the past seven years . the office rejected cnn 's request for the full training records because bates ' case is under investigation . branstetter said she 's run into similar obstacles when asking for the names of supervisors who 'd signed off on bates ' training records . `` you would think the sheriff 's office , if in fact there has been no pressure applied , no falsification of records , that they would be forthcoming with these documents , '' she told cnn 's `` new day . '' `` we 've asked for them . they 've said they do n't believe they 're public records . '' bates was classified as an advanced reserve deputy for the sheriff 's office . that means he would have had to complete 480 hours of the field training officer program to maintain that classification , the paper said . bates would also have needed firearms certification training . but the sheriff himself has acknowledged there is a problem with bates ' gun certification records -- his office ca n't find them . `` bob went out and qualified with three different weapons with an instructor , '' glanz told kfaq radio this week . he said bates `` qualified with a young lady that was a firearms instructor . '' but she is no longer there . `` she has left the sheriff 's office and is now a secret service agent , '' glanz told kfaq . `` and we 're trying to get a hold of her and talk to her about ... we ca n't find the records that she supposedly turned in . so we 're going to talk to her and find out if for sure he did qualify with those . '' opinion : who gave this reserve cop a gun ? even before the tulsa world story , inconsistencies were apparent in bates ' history with the sheriff 's office . in his statement to investigators , bates said he `` became an advanced tcso reserve deputy in 2007 . '' but the tulsa county sheriff 's office has said bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008 . it also said bates had undergone 300 hours of training . that would be less than the 480 hours of field training that the tulsa world said is required to be an `` advanced '' reserve deputy , which bates claimed to be . in a statement he made to investigators after the shooting , bates said the gun he used was his personal weapon , adding that he last qualified at the range in autumn . he also said he 'd attended `` numerous schools and seminars related to drug investigations and the tactical operations associated with the apprehension of suspects involved in drug trafficking , '' a five-day homicide investigation school in dallas and training from arizona 's maricopa county sheriff 's office on responding to active shooters . but an arizona official told cnn bates never trained with the agency . `` he did n't come to arizona , '' the official from the maricopa county sheriff 's office said , `` and he certainly did n't train with us . '' brewster said that line in bates ' statement was referring to a lecture given at a seminar in washington by maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio . the seminar was part of extensive training bates received at classes across the country and through work in the field , he said . `` he met every training regimen , '' brewster said . `` he met every requirement , and all he did was give of himself . '' bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter for harris ' death . he turned himself in to authorities tuesday and immediately posted bail of $ 25,000 . his attorney has said he 's not guilty , calling the death an `` excusable homicide . '' the lawyer for harris ' family claims bates was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff -- an accusation officials deny , saying they stand by his training record . tulsa police sgt. jim clark , who has been brought in to review the case , has said bates fell `` victim '' to something called `` slip and capture , '' a term to describe a high-stress situation in which a person intends to do one thing and instead does something else . it 's a controversial claim that has n't convinced critics of the department , and calls for an independent investigation into the sheriff 's office and the case are growing . earlier this week , the office spokesman rejected any idea of outside investigators into the shooting . `` we 're not scared to prosecute our own . ... there 's nobody in this culture that can be tougher on cops than their own , '' clark said . `` you know that analogy that you 'll eat your young ? you know , that 's the same thing in law enforcement . if we have a dirty cop in our ranks , we will disclose them much quicker than the media . '' a spokesman for oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt said his office is concerned about allegations reported in the media about the case `` and will continue to monitor and assess what appropriate measures , if any , are warranted . '' glanz has stated publicly that he 's reached out to the regional office of the fbi to look into the shooting . special agent terry b. weber told cnn there 's no open fbi investigation into the case . how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? cnn 's ed lavandera reported from tulsa . cnn 's holly yan and catherine e. shoichet reported from atlanta . cnn 's dave alsup and jason morris contributed to this report .a\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' takei , who with his family spent time in one of the camps , thanked people for working to stop the sale . according to a comment on the facebook page `` japanese american history : not for sale , '' he was working on the issue while on a trip to australia . `` it took a few calls today here in the wee hours , and i 'll be issuing a formal statement later , but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news , '' he wrote . the auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed . during world war ii , about 117,000 people of japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps . the government called them relocation centers . many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities . they call them concentration camps . two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born u.s. citizens , according to the national archives . cnn affiliate kgo reported the items were given to historian allen eaton , who opposed internment camps . the items were inherited from the historian 's estate . miriam tucker , a partner with the auction house , said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning . `` for us , there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum , foundation or members of the japanese-american community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education , display and research , '' she said . kgo reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition . `` this was a gift and let the gift come full circle , '' said judy hamaguchi with the san francisco chapter of the japanese american citizens league . she was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house . `` it should be returned as a gift .

      "b\"\\xb52-lrb- cnn -rrb- from late january , when new england was living through one of its bleakest and snowiest winters , to a warm and sunny afternoon in april , the jurors in the first-degree murder trial of former nfl star aaron hernandez have considered how a promising young athlete who earned millions came to take the life of his onetime friend and future brother-in-law , odin lloyd . the jury of seven women and five men listened to more than 130 witnesses and reviewed more than 400 pieces of evidence over the months-long trial . on wednesday , they convicted hernandez , who was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole , after deliberating more than 35 hours over parts of seven days . after the verdict , jurors agreed to meet with reporters , at times laughing nervously while shedding light on what some described as the grueling deliberation process . here are five things to know about what they said : . while declining to discuss specifics of what happened in the jury room , jurors said they came away satisfied with their decision . `` it 's a very big decision to make , and every one of us ... made sure we came to the best conclusion , '' one juror told reporters . at one point on monday , jurors asked judge susan garsh to allow smoking breaks , which were permitted during trial . some observers thought this signaled weeks of deliberations . a male juror said some panel members had meticulously filled four to eight notebooks as they listened to testimony . `` it was hard ... for everyone , '' said a woman on the jury . `` everyone 's life changed because of this . '' asked to elaborate , she told a reporter , `` i 've been here for as long as you have . '' `` it 's the hardest thing i 've ever done in my life , '' she said later about serving on the jury . `` absolutely , by far . '' asked whether they would say anything to hernandez , one of the women on the panel said simply , `` nothing . '' others nodded in apparent agreement . do they have any feelings about the 25-year-old former star ? `` for me , judge garsh said , ` keep your mind suspended , ' '' said a female juror . `` we went in there every day with open minds . we listened to the evidence . we heard what they had to say . we got to go into a room and see and touch and feel all the evidence and that 's when we came to our conclusion . '' did they know anything about hernandez or the case before the trial ? one juror responded : `` nothing . '' `` very little , '' said another . about six jurors raised their hands when asked who among them was a new england patriots fan . the jurors said they found out about hernandez 's other legal woes from garsh only after they reached a verdict . hernandez potentially faces three more trials , one criminal and two civil actions . next up is another murder trial in which he is accused of killing two men and wounding another person near a boston nightclub in july 2012 . prosecutors have said hernandez fatally shot daniel de abreu and safiro furtado when he fired into their 2003 bmw . another passenger was wounded and two others were uninjured . hernandez pleaded not guilty at his arraignment . the families of de abreu and furtado filed civil suits against hernandez , and a judge froze his $ 5 million in assets , pending the outcome of the double-murder trial . the freeze includes the disputed $ 3.3 million signing bonus payment hernandez claims he is owed by the new england patriots . hernandez is also being sued by a man who claims hernandez shot him while they were in a limousine in miami in february 2013 . alexander bradley claims hernandez wounded him after the two got into a fight at a miami strip club . `` it 's amazing a lot of the information we learned today , '' a female juror said wednesday . `` i think we can all say we made the right decision . '' some jurors admitted to not knowing who patriots owner robert kraft was when he took the stand at the trial . but they agreed that kraft 's testimony was crucial . kraft testified that hernandez proclaimed his innocence to him and told the team owner that `` he hoped that the time of the murder ... came out because i believe he said he was in a club . '' `` to this day -- we just went through a three-month trial , and this is now two years later -- we still do n't know the exact time of odin 's murder , '' a male juror said . `` so i do n't know how aaron would have had that information two years ago . '' another juror was struck by the emotional testimony of lloyd 's family and friends . `` for me , it was in the beginning -- the pictures , '' a woman said of autopsy photos of lloyd 's bullet-riddled body . `` you 're told to be unemotional and to sit there and hold back tears ... -lrb- that -rrb- was hard . '' one man said his time on the case made him `` appreciate how quickly life can end and how fleeting it can be . '' and that the justice system can work . `` the system is designed to be fair to both sides , '' he said . `` in fairness , you ca n't rush . '' the jurors did not find credible the defense team 's contention that hernandez 's co-defendants -- ernest wallace and carlos ortiz -- carried out the murder . the two men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . in closing arguments , defense lawyer james sultan for the first time placed hernandez at the murder scene . sultan described wallace and ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on pcp , as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage . `` did he make all the right decisions ? no , '' sultan said of hernandez . `` he was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something , committed by somebody he knew . he really did n't know what to do , so he put one foot in front of another . keep in mind , he 's not charged with accessory after the fact . ... he 's charged with murder ... and that he did not do . '' `` we were all shocked about that , '' a female juror told reporters wednesday . `` it was very surprising , '' said another . asked about post-trial fame or the possibility of book deals for their role in the sensational case , a female juror smiled . `` none of us wanted to come into this room , '' she told the reporters gathered around her . the jurors said they expected to sleep peacefully wednesday night . `` after a beverage , '' one of them added . asked whether they were leaving the experience as friends , they all seemed to say , `` yes .

      "b\"\\xe4\\x19-lrb- cnn -rrb- while the fight against isis in syria and iraq holds the world 's gaze , a simultaneous transformation is getting less attention : the deterioration of al qaeda . in an audio message released sunday , al qaeda confirmed that two of its leaders , known as ustad ahmad farooq and qari abdullah mansur , were killed in cia drone strikes in january in north waziristan , near the afghan-pakistan border . farooq 's real name was raja mohammad suleman , al qaeda said . he was a pakistani who acted as the group 's liaison to the pakistan taliban and was the deputy commander of al qaeda 's south asia branch . -lrb- mansur 's real name was qari ubaidullah , a pakistani who oversaw suicide missions against u.s. and nato troops in afghanistan -rrb- . al qaeda 's south asia branch is relatively new , announced with some fanfare back in september by al qaeda 's top leader , ayman al-zawahiri . the creation of the terror group 's south asia branch was seen by some terrorism analysts as an attempt to steal some of the limelight from isis , which is embroiled in a public dispute with al qaeda for leadership of the global jihad movement . the deaths of the two men continue the decimation of al qaeda 's bench of leaders . on monday , in the southern pakistani city of karachi , local al qaeda commander nurul hassan was killed in a raid , said arif hanif , district inspector general of police . florida-raised adnan shukrijumah , 39 , who was in charge of al qaeda 's operations to attack the west , was killed in december in a pakistani military operation . texas-born mohanad mahmoud al farekh , who also played a planning role for al qaeda 's operations , was arrested in pakistan last year . the deaths of ubaidullah and suleman underline the fact that there are almost no top leaders of al qaeda left except al-zawahiri . both ubaidullah and suleman were pakistani . this is an indicator of how al qaeda has become a largely pakistan-focused group , increasingly able to do nothing of any significance outside of pakistan or afghanistan . indeed , al qaeda has virtually no capacity to carry out attacks in the west . the last successful al qaeda attack in the west was the london transportation system bombings a decade ago . al qaeda is now reduced only to holding american hostages such as 73-year-old aid worker warren weinstein , who was kidnapped from his home in the pakistani city of lahore on august 13 , 2011 . to be sure , al qaeda 's yemen-based affiliate , al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , or aqap , continues to pose a threat to american aviation . the group has built hard-to-detect bombs , which it has placed on u.s.-bound flights . luckily , those bombs were faulty or were detected . the group also trained one of the gunmen who attacked the offices of the satirical magazine charlie hebdo in paris in january , killing 12 , but it 's not clear if aqap had any direct role in planning this attack . meanwhile , isis continues to attract western recruits and also inspire `` homegrown '' terrorists in the west , but the core al qaeda organization that killed almost 3,000 men , women and children on 9/11 is on life support . al qaeda 's confirmation of the deaths of ubaidullah and suleman is just one of the latest pieces of evidence for this assessment .R\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xcb'los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- former rap mogul marion `` suge '' knight was ordered thursday to stand trial for murder and other charges stemming from a deadly hit-and-run confrontation on the movie set of the biopic `` straight outta compton '' earlier this year . in addition to that ruling , judge ronald coen also lowered knight 's bail to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , a figure that defense lawyers called excessive . the judge also dismissed one of the two counts of hit-and-run against knight . in all , knight will stand trial on one count of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of hit-and-run , the judge ruled after holding a two-day preliminary hearing this week that ended thursday . knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted . knight suffers diabetes and blot clots , and the case has clearly strained him : he collapsed in court last month after learning of the $ 25 million bail and he was taken to the hospital for treatment . knight was in court thursday . at the end of hearing , he turned around and looked at his family in the gallery , and he smiled to his fiancee as deputies led him handcuffed out of the courtroom . in a press conference after the hearing , fiancee toi kelly said regarding knight 's health that he is `` doing much better . '' the judge dismissed the other hit-and-run count because california law says no more than one charge of hit-and-run should be brought against a defendant when the same weapon , in this case the vehicle knight was driving , is used against several people . knight is accused of running over two men , killing one of them , during an argument . killed was terry carter , 55 . the survivor is cle sloan , 51 , who in testimony this week declined to identify knight as his attacker because sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends knight to prison , according to cnn affiliates kabc and ktla . prosecutors offered sloan immunity , but he still refused to testify against knight on monday , the affiliates reported . the deadly incident happened on january 29 , after a flare-up on the set of the biopic `` straight outta compton , '' a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group n.w.a. . the alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of tam 's burgers in compton . at the time , knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case . the hit-and-run was captured on videotape and allegedly shows knight inside a red truck . in the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the compton restaurant , and he is then approached by sloan , who was working security on the site . the two men appear to talk for a few moments , with knight still in his vehicle . suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking sloan to the ground . while still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera . the vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over sloan a second time , and then running over a second man , carter , a former rap music label owner . carter later died . in closing arguments prior to the judge 's ruling , knight 's attorney matthew fletcher argued that knight was the victim . knight was only defending himself against sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time . `` mr. sloan is the initial and consistent aggressor , '' knight 's attorney argued . `` there 's no intent to kill , there 's an intent to survive . '' `` even without a gun , we know mr. sloan was brave enough to attack in broad daylight , '' the defense attorney said . fletcher added that knight 's defense was to stand his ground . sloan `` needed immunity because he was the actual aggressor , '' fletcher said . `` he is the person who got terry -lrb- carter -rrb- killed . '' los angeles county deputy district attorney cynthia barnes argued , however , told the judge that knight was engaged in `` mutual combat situation '' where he used his car as deadly weapon . if knight `` ever had the right of self-defense , the moment he backed-up and mr. sloan was ran-over , he lost the right of self-defense , '' barnes said . `` there was pre-mediation and intent when he -lrb- knight -rrb- ran over him a second time . '' knight is scheduled to be arraigned on april 30 . the incident is the latest run-in with the law for knight , who founded the wildly successful death row records in 1991 and signed artists such as snoop doggy dogg -lrb- now known as snoop lion -rrb- and tupac shakur . knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in 1996 . shortly afterward , knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions . that prison time -- along with shakur 's death , feuds between knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by dr. dre , snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006 . in august , knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards .G\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xed--lrb- cnn -rrb- robert bates says he gets it , how you might wonder how a cop could confuse a pistol for a stun gun . bates -- the tulsa county , oklahoma , reserve sheriff 's deputy accused of manslaughter in the death of a fleeing suspect -- told nbc 's `` today '' show friday that he used to think that , too . `` believe me , '' he told the show in his first appearance since being charged in the april 2 death of eric harris , `` it can happen to anyone . '' harris died after bates shot him -- accidentally , he says -- after calling out `` taser ! taser ! '' in a tussle captured on a police body camera . bates told investigators that he mistook his firearm for the stun gun . how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? while bates is at the center of the maelstrom over harris ' death , he is n't the only one under scrutiny . the oklahoma naacp wants charges against other officers involved in harris ' death , and a state and federal investigation into the tulsa county sheriff 's office 's treatment of minorities . the sheriff 's office also finds itself fending off allegations that supervisors were told to forge bates ' training records . in his interview friday with `` today , '' bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies . `` that is absolutely the truth . i have it in writing , '' he told the show . and on thursday , a sheriff 's office official denied to the tulsa world newspaper that any records had ever been forged . as an advanced reserve deputy , sheriff 's office policy calls for bates to have completed 480 hours of the field training officer program , according to the tulsa world . bates would also have needed firearms certification training . officials have yet to locate records showing what training bates completed , said maj. shannon clark of the sheriff 's office . but clark did say it 's possible that some training requirements may have been waived . sheriff stanley glanz has the authority to waive any department policies , clark said . `` the policies within our organization are signed off by the sheriff , but there are also policies that give the sheriff the ability to waive any policy within our organization . that 's part of being a sheriff 's office , '' clark told the newspaper . glanz told kfaq radio this week that officials ca n't find records of bates ' firearms certification . the instructor who provided that training is now a u.s. secret service agent , and officials have n't been able to locate training records she was supposed to have turned in , glanz told the station . other discrepancies have surfaced about training that bates claims to have attended , including questions about active shooter and homicide investigation instruction . tulsa world reporter dylan goforth said the paper had been told by multiple sources that bates ' records had been falsified . the newspaper has not said who allegedly asked the supervisors to falsify the training records or why . but the orders apparently started years ago , `` back when -lrb- bates -rrb- was trying to get on as a deputy , '' reporter ziva branstetter told cnn 's `` new day . '' bates has donated equipment to the department and was also a donor to glanz 's re-election campaign , leading to allegations he had essentially paid to be a cop . he rejected that claim in the `` today '' interview as `` unbelievably unfair . '' bates ' attorney , clark brewster , also has rejected the allegations of poor training or forgery as unfounded . he said those making the accusations include fired sheriff 's office employees represented by the law firm that also represents harris ' family . `` his training is extensive and certainly adequate , '' brewster told cnn on thursday . bates appeared on the `` today '' show with his wife , two daughters and brewster . he seemed composed but said he was still might be in shock over what had happened . `` i can tell you it stayed with me for a number of days , '' bates said . `` i 'm not at all sure it 's not still with me today . lack of sleep , inability to concentrate , all of those plus more . you know , i still ca n't believe it happened . '' in describing the events leading up to harris ' death , bates said he was parked several blocks away from the site where an undercover deputy was conducting a sting operation to catch harris in the act of illegally selling a gun . bates said he had participated in `` several hundred '' such operations but always in a backup role where he would come in and `` clean up '' after deputies , taking photos and notes . but as deputies rolled up to arrest him after the sale , harris bolted from the vehicle and ran toward bates ' position . as deputies were trying to subdue harris , bates told investigators he saw an opportunity to use his stun gun to help get the suspect under control . `` i yelled , ` taser ! taser ! ' as required in training . the deputy below me ducked , he pulled away from it so that i could , '' bates said . `` the laser light is the same on each weapon . i saw the light and i squeezed the trigger , '' bates told `` today . '' the result was not the staccato click of a well-deployed stun gun . instead , it was a gunshot . `` i shot him ! i 'm sorry ! '' bates is heard emotionally saying on video of the incident . bates apologized to harris ' family , who have rejected allegations he was violent and on drugs . harris ' brother , andre harris , said this week that he did n't think the shooting was racially motivated . instead , he said , `` this is simply evil . '' but bates , who is charged with second-degree manslaughter , said he did n't mean to kill harris . his attorney has called it an `` excusable homicide . '' `` i rate this as no. 1 on my list of things in my life that i regret , '' said bates , who is free on $ 25,000 bail .\\x96\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' now , the human rights commission must decide whether to investigate flack 's allegations against the king , who denies fueling any violence . flack hopes others will also make complaints . flack added that zulus are n't the only people in south africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment . `` people are frustrated and unemployed , and people in south africa pay foreign nationals a lot less , '' he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants . `` a domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house , whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand , so it causes resentment . '' imtiaz sooliman , founder and chairman of the gift of givers foundation in durban , does n't think most south africans are against foreigners . `` south africans are against xenophobia , '' said sooliman , who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals . gift of givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the south african government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees , he said , passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs . the organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia . why ? `` in south africa , everyone knows xenophobia , '' sooliman said , `` and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand . so if you say #tsunami or #war , people follow it . so here , people say #xenophobia , and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster , so you are going to post what people understand . '' he said south africans also have been going to the camps , which are on sports fields with makeshift tents , bringing cooked food and other necessities . `` this is different from what happened in 2008 , '' sooliman said . that year , scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of johannesburg . most of the victims were zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances . sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence , community engagement is happening now as it never happened before . it is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story : #weareafrica . only time , or , tweets will tell if it works .\\x87\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd7*panama city beach , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- a third person has been arrested in the case of an alleged spring break gang rape that was videotaped on a crowded stretch of panama city beach , the bay county , florida , sheriff 's office said wednesday . police arrested the suspect at 11 p.m. tuesday . `` after developing information that george davon kennedy was the third suspect seen in the video of the gang rape , bcso investigators obtained a warrant for his arrest , '' according to a news release . investigators discovered that kennedy had family in dekalb county , georgia , and reached out to the sheriff 's office there . deputies in dekalb , in the atlanta area , tracked down kennedy and arrested him on a charge of sexual assault by multiple perpetrators , the bay county sheriff 's office said . kennedy is from murfreesboro , tennessee , and has been a student at middle tennessee state university , the sheriff 's office said . previously , ryan calhoun and delonte martistee were arrested and charged with sexual battery by multiple perpetrators , the sheriff 's office said . calhoun was released saturday after posting $ 50,000 bond ; martistee remains in bay county jail , a county deputy said . troy university in alabama said the two are students and have been `` placed on temporary suspension from school per the university 's standards of conduct and disciplinary procedures . martistee , a member of the track and field team , has also been removed from the team . '' martistee is represented by a public defender . calhoun 's legal representation is unclear . no public statement has been made on either 's behalf . the arrests come after a woman told police she may have been drugged and gang-raped on a beach behind a popular club in broad daylight as bystanders watched . the woman did n't recall the assault , police say , but she saw the video of her alleged assault on the news , and though the footage had to be blurred , she recognized her tattoos and contacted authorities . it 's not the first time this has happened to a young woman in panama city beach , authorities say . four young men were involved in the assault , bay county sheriff frank mckeithen said , and while he previously said federal marshals were trying to track down a third suspect and investigators were seeking a possible witness , it 's unclear if the person arrested tuesday was someone the police had been looking for . `` there 's hundreds , hundreds of people standing there -- watching , looking , seeing , hearing what 's going on , '' mckeithen said . `` and yet our culture and our society and our young people have got to the point where obviously this is acceptable somewhere . i will tell you it is not acceptable in bay county . '' authorities have said they plan to interview the woman and show her the full video to see whether she knows the attackers and can help identify other suspects , said ruth corley , spokeswoman for the sheriff 's office . authorities are pressing charges , and the woman plans to cooperate , corley said . investigators were to meet with her this week . after interviewing witnesses , bay county investigators determined the alleged rape took place between march 10 and march 12 , behind spinnaker beach club , a popular bar and dance club for spring breakers . she `` does not remember the assault at all , '' corley said . `` she remembers taking a drink from a camelbak and there is a strong possibility she was drugged . '' -lrb- camelbak sells various products for transporting water or other drinks . -rrb- . she was visiting panama city beach at the time of the assault , and is now home , authorities said . the troy , alabama , police department found the video during the course of an investigation into an unrelated shooting and turned it over to the bay county sheriff 's office . the video shows suspects pushing the victim 's hand aside and holding her legs down , corley said . `` you can see in the video there are people two feet away . they were assaulting her , and we believe the people around her knew she was being assaulted . '' the suspects can be heard commenting about what they are doing to her , corley said . authorities have three sworn statements from witnesses stating that the assault happened , corley said . the sheriff 's office released part of the video to local tv stations , which blurred portions of it before airing . cnn is showing part of what was released . while the video is `` one of the most disgusting , repulsive , sickening things that i 've seen this year on panama city beach , '' it 's not an isolated incident , mckeithen said . `` this is not the first video we 've recovered . it 's not the second video . it 's not the third video . there 's a number of videos we 've recovered with things similar to this , and i can only imagine how many things we have n't recovered . '' corley said that through social media , `` we have been able to find video of girls , incoherent and passed out , and almost like they are drugged , being assaulted on the beaches of panama city in front of a bunch of people standing around . '' about 100,000 spring break revelers come to the beach community every year . this year , the bay county sheriff 's office made more than 1,000 arrests for various crimes -- about triple the number of arrests made in the same period last year . cnn 's anneclaire stapleton , josh levs and alexandra field contributed to this report .\\xad\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x9d\\x1f-lrb- cnn -rrb- it would be easy to laugh off vin diesel 's prediction that his film `` furious 7 '' will win an oscar next year , but not for the reason you might think . after all , the actor was serious when he recently told variety `` it will probably win best picture at the oscars , unless the oscars do n't want to be relevant ever . '' but rather than ignore it because it 's a glossy , blockbuster action film , some might argue that the movie goes against type for academy award nominated films because the cast is so diverse . `` furious 7 '' hits theaters friday , months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the oscars . there were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category , which was dominated by white males . mexican filmmaker alejandro gonzalez i\\xc3\\xb1arritu went on to win best director for `` birdman . '' the lack of diversity was so glaring -lrb- even with the mostly black cast of the movie `` selma , '' which received a nomination for best picture -rrb- that it spurred the twitter hashtag '' #oscarssowhite . '' in contrast , `` furious 7 '' could n't be more racially and ethnically inclusive . the cast includes dwayne `` the rock '' johnson -- a samoan/black man -- black actors christopher `` ludacris '' bridges and tyrese gibson , hispanic performer michelle rodriguez , thai martial artist tony jaa , beninese expatriate djimon hounsou and the late paul walker , a blue-eyed , blond-haired california native . the filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in abu dhabi and dubai , where key scenes were filmed , found diverse extras . `` we were mainly looking for the diverse look of the -lrb- united arab emirates -rrb- , '' miranda davidson , owner of the casting company , told the national . `` they really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country . '' almost since the beginning , the `` fast and furious '' films have had a diverse focus and appeal . the band of street racers , which encompassed white , black , asian , hispanic , male and female and bond as a family , has done well at the box office with each iteration . in 2011 , then boston globe film critic wesley morris wrote , `` go on and laugh your benetton , kumbaya , kashi , quinoa laugh , but it 's true : the most progressive force in hollywood today is the ` fast and furious ' movies . '' `` they 're loud , ludicrous , and visually incoherent , '' he said . `` they 're also the last bunch of movies you 'd expect to see in the same sentence as ` incredibly important . ' but they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation . -lrb- and this does n't even account for the gay tension between the male leads , and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out . -rrb- '' according to the motion picture association of america 's 2014 theatrical market statistics report , while hispanics make up 17 % of the u.s. population they account for 25 % of frequent moviegoers . likewise , women make up 52 % of moviegoers . entertainment weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in hollywood . `` despite the films ' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $ 2.4 billion , their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier ; american movies are still overwhelmingly white , '' ew 's chris lee writes . `` according to ucla 's 2015 hollywood diversity report , a mere 16.7 % of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles . '' at least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort . diesel told ew the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film , which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other . `` it does n't matter what nationality you are , '' the star said . `` as a member of the audience , you realize you can be a member of that ` family .

      "b\"\\xad\\x17-lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands of syrian and palestinian refugees trapped in the yarmouk refugee camp have suffered what can only be described as untold indignities . but while the story is in itself tragic , it is the individual lives at the heart of the camp that make the imperative for humanitarian action so compelling . i encountered two such individuals on my mission to damascus -- jihad and mohammad -- tiny , vulnerable infants who were taken from yarmouk in recent days , a place that was described last week by the u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon as `` the deepest circle of hell . '' the fact that they are alive truly make them miracle children . looking into those bright young faces , touching their pristine hands , the logic of our humanitarian mandate -- the mission to protect -- never felt stronger to me . like the wider syrian conflict , yarmouk has a human face ; the faces of young mohammad and young jihad . i want to introduce you to them in the hope that you , too , will understand why i am firmly convinced that turning away is not an option -- and why the international community must act in a concerted manner to respond to the many tragedies in syria . jihad ya ` qoub , the youngest palestinian refugee to flee yarmouk , was born on march 30 . his mother , said fatima , never imagined bringing a child into this world could be so tough . `` i was hoping to drink milk and eat eggs during my pregnancy , but our financial situation did allow us to buy these expensive food items , '' she said . said fatima was living in a community where the average person survived on just 400 calories a day . mohammad was born in yarmouk on january 25 of this year . when isis -- islamic state of iraq and syria -- entered the camp and tensions heightened , his mother , nadia , fled in search of safety . her only thoughts were to save the life of her newborn son . yet she has not lost hope in the possibility of a dignified future . she hopes that if and when life returns to normal , she will be able to live once more with her husband and son in the family home in yarmouk . these tales of courage and human dignity are a lesson for us all . when i next brief the security council , as i did a few days ago , i will tell them about jihad and mohammad . i will continue to press the case for humanitarian access to other children like them inside yarmouk , other civilians who need help where they are . to do this , hostilities will have to subside . pressure must be exerted on armed actors in yarmouk to this end . beyond that , those civilians wishing to temporarily leave must be allowed to do so safely . these things are all possible . but it takes the necessary political will -- nothing more , nothing less . yarmouk must be a place where the politics of the possible begin to take hold . i believe they can . because to abandon such belief would be to abandon jihad , mohammad and thousands of other civilians like them . and that is simply not an option .\\x90\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' what worries authorities here is exactly that -- mohamud was kenyan . but now , say officials , mohamud is in command of an al-shabaab militia based near kenya 's long , porous border with somalia -- about 118 miles -lrb- 190km -rrb- from garissa -- who are believed to be responsible for numerous cross-border attacks into kenya . the islamist militant group , who are allied with al qaeda , have been waging a bloody campaign for control of somalia . with kenyan troops part of an african union force deployed in support of somalia 's united nations-supported government , kenya has now become a target . last year , an attack by al-shabaab on a shopping center in the country 's capital , nairobi , claimed the lives of 68 people . now mohamud stands accused of being behind thursday 's attack -- the deadliest attack in the nation since al qaeda killed more than 200 people at the u.s. embassy in nairobi in 1998 . but mohamud is not kenya 's only homegrown terrorist . the kenyan interior ministry has said at least one of the four gunmen who carried out the attack on the university was also kenyan . abdirahim abdullahi was in his 20s and the son of a government chief . his father says he lost contact with his son in 2013 , shortly after he left university . the kenyan government is concerned that al-shabaab is recruiting disaffected youth from inside the country . `` our task of countering terrorism has been made all the more difficult by the fact that the planners and financiers of this brutality are deeply embedded in our communities , '' president kenyatta said during an address to the nation in the aftermath of the massacre . meanwhile , sheikh khalif insists his madrassa has nothing to do with mohamud 's extreme , violent ideas . `` this man is a dangerous man , a killer , a criminal , '' he says . but he was also once a neighbor . and so kenyans must now look within to tackle this very real threat to the country 's -- and the region 's -- stability .\\x82\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc1+-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's not easy being the pope . not only does he shepherd nearly 1 billion catholic souls , he also leads a small but morally significant state with envoys and interests in nearly every country . as scholars like to say , the vatican has walked the line between spiritual and worldly concerns for centuries . sometimes , as when st. john paul ii stood up to communist poland , the church 's moral and political clout have combined to pack a powerful punch . at other times , popes have to make a hard choice : adopt the sharp tongue of a prophet or the discretion of a diplomat ? this sunday in rome , pope francis faced just such a dilemma . first , the back story : . one hundred years ago , more than 1 million armenians -lrb- some estimates run as high as 1.5 million -rrb- died at the hand of the turks . many of the victims were part of a branch of christianity closely aligned with catholicism . a slew of historians and at least 20 countries call the killings a `` genocide . '' -lrb- a u.s. resolution to do the same has languished in congress . -rrb- turkish officials disagree , arguing that the deaths , while unfortunate , were part of a long-running war that witnessed casualties on all sides . for their part , previous popes had finessed the genocide question . john paul ii used the `` g '' word in 2001 , but did n't dare speak it out loud . instead , it was tucked into a document signed by the former pontiff and the head of the armenian church , after they had celebrated mass together . pope emeritus benedict xvi called the killings `` a great evil '' and `` terrible persecution '' in a speech 2006 , but avoided labeling them genocide . -lrb- benedict found other ways to tick off the turks , initially opposing their entry into the european union . -rrb- . as pope francis prepared to celebrate a special mass sunday to commemorate a century since the slaughter , vatican watchers were divided about whether he would use the word `` genocide . '' he did , but in a roundabout way , by quoting john paul 's document . `` in the past century , our human family has lived through three massive and unprecedented tragedies , '' francis said . `` the first , which is widely considered ` the first genocide of the 20th century , ' struck your own armenian people . '' the middle phrase comes directly from the document issued 14 years ago by john paul . in citing his predecessor , francis highlighted one of the vatican 's chiefest concerns , especially on matters of moral import : continuity . whether holding the line against artificial birth control , declining to ordain female priests or dealing with diplomatic tensions , it sometimes seems as if the church considers inconsistency the most unforgivable of sins . `` the vatican and the papacy love continuity , '' said the rev. thomas reese , a vatican analyst for national catholic reporter . if francis had not called the armenian killings a genocide , particularly at such a high-profile event -- the audience included armenia 's president -- it might have been interpreted as a change in church policy , reese said . at the same time , francis did n't want to anger the turks more than necessary , especially since they have become a key ally against the persecution of christians by isis in the middle east , which the pope alluded to in his speech on sunday . `` the fact that he quoted john paul is a sign that he 's downplaying it , '' reese said of the armenian murders . `` he 's telling people : there 's nothing new here . '' new or not , turkey was not happy . the nation recalled its vatican ambassador for `` consultations '' just hours after francis ' comments , the turkish foreign ministry said . turkey also promptly summoned his counterpart , the vatican 's ambassador , for a meeting , turkish state broadcaster trt reported . in a tweet sunday , turkey 's foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu called the pope 's use of the word `` unacceptable '' and `` out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis . '' `` religious authorities are not places through which hatred and animosity are fueled by unfounded allegations , '' the tweet reads . `` hatred '' and `` animosity '' are not words often used to describe pope francis . because he often shines a sympathetic face on the world , emphasizing mercy over judgment , it 's easy to miss the bluntness francis brings to the bully pulpit . on matters of doctrine and diplomacy , he may be carrying on catholic traditions , but in his willingness to engage in geopolitics and the tone that engagement often takes , this pope is decidedly different . he has helped broker a backroom detente between the united states and cuba , and invited israeli and palestinian leaders for an unprecedented prayer service at the vatican -lrb- after annoying some israelis with an impromptu prayer at the wall that separates the west bank from jerusalem . -rrb- . but francis has also suggested that force may be justified to stop isis ' slaughter of christians , warned of the `` mexicanization '' of argentina and said that satirists who insult religion should expect a retaliatory punch . on monday , the pope addressed a roomful of priests at morning mass. . he must have heard the hubbub about his `` genocide '' remark , but he encouraged his charges to speak frankly , without fear , and to bear the courage of their convictions , just as the early apostles had . `` we can not keep silent about what we have seen and heard , '' francis said . cnn 's gul tuysuz and jethro mullen contributed to this report .\\xb0\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xcc\\x15-lrb- cnn -rrb- canadian actor jonathan crombie , who co-starred in the `` anne of green gables '' tv movies , died this week at age 48 . crombie died wednesday from complications of a brain hemorrhage , `` anne of green gables '' producer kevin sullivan said . `` it 's a real tragedy to see someone at age 48 go like that , '' he said . `` i will remember him as someone who worked extremely hard to make the roles he played onscreen come to life . '' based on canadian author lucy maud montgomery 's children 's books , `` anne of green gables '' debuted in canada on cbc tv in 1984 and became a cultural touchstone . the plot focused on the adventures of fiery orphan anne shirley , played by megan follows , who is sent to live on a farm in prince edward island . crombie played gilbert blythe , who evolves over time from anne 's pigtail-tugging tormentor to friend to husband . follows and crombie reprised the roles in the sequels `` anne of avonlea '' -lrb- 1987 -rrb- and `` anne of green gables : the continuing story '' -lrb- 2000 -rrb- . the movies were carried in the united states by the disney channel and pbs , drawing a cult following beyond canada and extending to japan , which made its own animated series based on the books . crombie , son of former toronto mayor david crombie , was cast in the role at 17 , beating out other aspiring canadian actors of the era , including jason priestly , sullivan said . despite his lack of acting experience , crombie 's boy-next-door looks and cool demeanor made him the perfect actor to star opposite follows , sullivan said . `` it was an amazing chemistry between him and megan follows , '' sullivan said . `` there was a lot of affection , but they kind of grounded each other . '' the movies spawned various spinoffs , including `` road to avonlea , '' starring child actor sarah polley , and turned anne 's fictional home on prince edward island into a popular tourist destination . the role made crombie a heartthrob of his time , a sentiment expressed by many fans in the wake of his death . as one person said on twitter , `` i do n't know any female canadian from my generation that * did n't * have at least a little bit of a crush on jonathan crombie as gilbert . '' crombie went on to play roles in other american and canadian tv shows , including `` 21 jump street '' and `` the good wife , '' but even his facebook page acknowledges he is best known for his portrayal of gilbert blythe . crombie 's sister told cbc news that her brother happily answered to the name gil when greeted by fans in public . `` i think he was really proud of being gilbert blythe , '' she said . `` he really enjoyed that series and was happy , very proud of it -- we all were . '' people we 've lost in 2015 .\\x06\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xed,-lrb- cnn -rrb- the lawyer for robert bates , an oklahoma reserve deputy who fatally shot a man he meant to subdue with a taser , on saturday released documents that he says verify some of bates ' training as a law enforcement officer . the documents show bates had one taser training class over a six-and-a-half-year period , took three firearms training classes and qualified 10 times , from 2009 to 2014 , to use a handgun . his evaluations say he got along with other officers and related well with the public . `` robert bates has met all the requisite training required by oklahoma to be a reserve deputy , '' said the lawyer , scott wood , in an interview with cnn . read the documents . cnn could not independently confirm the documents were authentic . wood said he got them from bates , who asked the tulsa county sheriff 's office to provide his training records . the sheriff 's office has turned down cnn 's requests for the training documents , saying they are part of the investigation . authorities did not reply saturday to a request for comment on wood 's statements . the documents are important because bates ' training has become a central issue in the case . the lawyer for the family of the man who was killed claims that bates , 73 , was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff . the tulsa world newspaper reported some supervisors in the tulsa county sheriff 's office were told to forge bates ' records and were reassigned when they refused . the tulsa county sheriff 's office has denied these allegations . the documents provided to cnn cover the period from july 22 , 2008 , to december 12 , 2014 . bates had one taser training class , on march 4 , 2009 , according to a document with a heading from the council on law enforcement education and training , which sets the standards for training peace officers in the state . wood said the council requires only one hands-on class on use of a taser . bates had weapons training once in september 2008 and twice in 2009 , according to sheriff 's office records that bates obtained , wood said . he scored high enough at the pistol range 10 times from september 24 , 2009 , to april 9 , 2014 , that he was allowed to carry a handgun while on duty , wood said . bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the death of eric harris . friends and family of harris gathered in tulsa on saturday afternoon for a visitation and viewing . bates is free on $ 25,000 bond . he says he meant to use his taser on harris during the april 2 arrest but accidentally fired his handgun instead . `` i shot him ! i 'm sorry ! '' bates is heard saying on video of the incident . bates , an insurance company executive , has gone to his own defense . in an interview friday with the `` today '' show on nbc , bates said he had the documentation to show he had completed the necessary training required of reserve deputies . `` that is absolutely the truth . i have it in writing , '' he told the show . questions have already been raised about bates ' training and when his service with the tulsa county sheriff 's office started . in his statement to investigators , bates said he `` became an advanced tcso reserve deputy in 2007 . '' wood said bates started working for the sheriff 's office in late 2007 or 2008 . but the sheriff 's office has said bates had been a reserve deputy since 2008 . bates , who worked as a police officer for one year in the 1960s , completed 300 hours of training and 1,100 hours of community policing experience since becoming a reserve deputy , according to the sheriff 's office . the tulsa world said 480 hours of field training are required to be an `` advanced '' reserve deputy , which bates claimed to be . questions have been raised about bates ' firearms qualifications scores . to be allowed to carry a pistol on duty , deputies need to score 72 while firing at a silhouette of a man at the firing range , wood said . documents with a heading `` firearms qualification record '' show bates scoring at least 72 on six different days . but firearms qualification records from four dates in 2012 and 2013 are missing for the entire sheriff 's office , wood said . the tulsa county sheriff 's office says it ca n't find the records . the department 's summary of bates ' weapons training shows he scored 80-84 those four times . `` if you 're going to forge somebody 's score why not give them a 90 or a 95 , '' wood said . cnn provided the documents to the tulsa world . ziva branstetter , an editor with the newspaper , said the new information does n't undercut the world 's reporting . `` these records back up the validity of our story and we stand by our story , '' she said saturday . another seeming oddity of the records is how many classes bates took on two days . the council on law enforcement education and training records show bates took 14 training classes worth 20 credit hours on december 10 , 2013 , and 20 classes worth 31 credit hours on december 11 , 2014 . wood said bates may have been cramming in his required training before the end of the year by taking computer classes . `` it 's possible you could take a half-hour class and if you know the material you could finish it in 15 minutes , '' he said . evaluations show supervisors had a good opinion of bates . one from march 14 , 2009 , says of his strengths : `` works well with his fellow officers and relates to the public very well . '' his weakness : `` radio usage/geography . '' remedial training : `` does not have a lot of radio usage time which will be worked on . will have to work on his geography skills . both will be remedied in time !

      "b\"\\x9d2-lrb- cnn -rrb- most airline pilots have an above average ability to compartmentalize personal problems . the cockpit is our `` safe '' place . the flight deck is a structured world of black and white . checklists . procedures . standardization . stress from the job is an accepted part of our career . however , sometimes during the course of an airline pilot 's career , or anyone 's career for that matter , stress issues may manifest as depression . depression is treatable . and for airline pilots , it is no longer debilitating to our livelihood . the federal aviation administration now approves certain prescribed medication , allowing us to continue flying until depression is no longer a factor . as the world learns more about andreas lubitz , the co-pilot on germanwings flight 9525 , it is readily apparent that this young man had psychiatric issues far beyond clinical depression . he reportedly was administered a series of injections to mitigate his problems , an absolute reflection on the serious nature of his illness . but lubitz 's illness did n't just appear out of thin air . its effects had to be apparent to others . lubitz 's girlfriend made her concerns public knowledge -- unfortunately after events took their course . considering the hoops lubitz had to jump through to have established himself as a germanwings co-pilot , it 's curious to me how the red flags of his illness were missed . to what hoops am i referring ? first , let 's start with his passion for gliders . glider flying is one of the purest forms of aviation . although it is mostly an individualistic endeavor , the sport involves teamwork . interaction among fellow enthusiasts is paramount to both enjoyment and safety . i 'm a glider pilot . participation among the members of my club uncovers the personalities and idiosyncrasies of each pilot . behaviors not quite conducive to the activity are readily apparent . second , lubitz had to compete successfully in a selection process just to have the opportunity to train through lufthansa 's flight program , a requirement of germanwings employment . the selection process is most likely highly competitive , requiring above-average aptitude . is the selection process flawed to the extent that a serious mental disorder would go unnoticed ? regardless , the process had to be a stressful experience . opinion : germanwings and the stigma of mental illness . once accepted into the flight program , a rigorous training period began . for primary training , lufthansa utilizes an ab initio -lrb- from the beginning -rrb- program based at a facility the airline owns in goodyear , arizona , near phoenix . the training is geared toward a multi-crew pilot license , or mpl , recognized by the international civil aviation organization . the purpose of an mpl is to funnel airline pilot candidates having little or no flight time into the right seat as first officers . countries that do n't have the luxury of selecting from a large pool of experienced pilots use this license . airline pilots in the united states are not licensed in this manner , requiring as much as 1,500 hours to qualify as a co-pilot . this is a fairly recent change in faa regulations , initiated as a result of the 2009 colgan airlines crash in buffalo , new york . lubitz had barely over 600 hours of flight time when he committed his act of horror . as a 21-year-old flight instructor , i had that much flight time ; it hardly qualified as a lot of experience . as with all of the mpl programs , the training involves an intense period of airline-specific instruction . and to add insult to injury , candidates are not paid during the training until such time as they pass a final check ride . regardless , the cost is borne by the student to the tune of about $ 76,000 . using both actual flight experience in a single-engine airplane and simulator time , the student receives about 250 hours of training . it is a period of almost constant supervision . aside from observing and checking performance criteria , would n't at least one instructor have noticed behavioral issues in such an intense environment ? and would n't a fellow trainee have noticed also ? according to reports , lubitz took a leave from his training -- a very untypical behavior . was that not in and of itself a red flag ? would n't a manager in lufthansa 's flight department consider it prudent to reconsider a candidate with an indication of potential issues ? after all , the selection process was most likely highly competitive , with other qualified candidates readily available . once the primary training in arizona was complete , lubitz would have returned to germany and completed more specific schooling on the airbus a320 he was about to fly . again , no one observed issues . but even more curious , according to reports , lubitz disclosed a diagnosis of previous depression to lufthansa . over the course of a career , an airline pilot spends thousands of hours sharing the confined space of the cockpit with colleagues . even if we have never flown with a particular individual , experience allows us the intuition to know when something is n't quite right . that determination can be made through performance observation of typical routines , or perhaps through a simple conversation . in that regard , i find it difficult to believe that none of lubitz 's colleagues made a less than positive assessment at some point in time . as supplemental background , germanwings had been established as the low-cost , alter ego carrier of lufthansa . depending upon a pilot 's monthly flight time , salary for pilots can be as much as 20 % lower than the mainline carrier . in addition , more days on duty were part of a germanwings crew member 's schedule . apparently as late as march 20 , lufthansa pilots had been on strike , one of the main disputes being an early retirement option and less desirable working conditions for new hires . perhaps enough of a disparity existed for germanwings pilots such that medical leave benefits would not have covered lubitz 's absence . regardless , all of these factors combined to add a perfect storm of stress to one sick 27-year-old man . the world knows the end result . it just seems to me that this was an accident waiting to happen . could it have been prevented ? well , this is the primary purpose of accident investigation : never allow the same tragedy to occur again .\\x88\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfb*-lrb- cnn -rrb- i remember traveling one day in the local train in mumbai with my mother , my younger sister and brother . the compartment was extremely crowded . as we prepared to disembark , i felt my skirt being lifted and someone groping my private parts . it was terrible . i wanted to scream , but my voice would have drowned in the noise of the crowd . i wanted to push the hands away , but my arms were pinned to my body . i wanted to cry but could only think to myself , `` stop it ! please stop touching me . '' i was 13 years old . i never told anyone about that day until recently . twenty-five years later , i continue to hear similar stories of women and girls being harassed on local transportation and other public spaces . the stories can be stomach churning : men masturbating on buses and at bus stops , boys stalking young girls -- both physically and online , men taking pictures of women without permission and uploading them on the internet . then there are just the everyday , uncomfortable stares , frequently accompanied by comments with sexual connotations . this is n't all simply anecdotal . a study by we the people found that 80 % of women in mumbai had been street harassed , primarily in crowded areas like trains and railway platforms . most people , including women , only think of sexual violence as rape and tend to overlook touching , groping and stalking , not to mention the `` milder '' forms of ogling , leering , catcalling and whistling , even though all of this can be intimidating . indeed , many women choose to limit their hours outside , select more conservative clothes , or opt for a longer but safer route home . it was only recently that i realized my phobia of trains likely originated with that bad experience i had as a child . i still avoid trains when i can . most people are silent when inappropriate sexual behavior occurs to women . it was depressing to hear one young college student tell me in a recent sexual harassment workshop i led that `` staring and commenting by men is normal and i 've learned to ignore it . '' the reality is that sexual harassment in india is pervasive in all aspects of life . it hits you in the face every day when you walk down the street , take local transport , go about your daily routine or at the workplace . according to u.n. women 's report , 1 in 3 women around the world face some form of sexual violence at least once in their lifetime . this statistic is likely even higher in india . out of the 2,000 women who have attended workshops i 've conducted , only a handful of them have never been at the receiving end of harassment in some setting of their daily lives . shockingly , less than 10 of them had reported harassment to any official channel . why are we constantly limiting our options rather than confronting sexual harassment ? over the past two years , i have been working to encourage women to talk about their experiences and realize the tremendous potential power they hold within themselves through acknowledging the problem and being a part of the change to shift the culture around sexual harassment in india . it is not always easy speaking up about sexual harassment . i know firsthand . but acknowledging that it is unacceptable is an important first step . india has laws for sexual violence in public spaces as well as at the workplace , and knowing these rules gives women the power to confront her harasser . but is it enough ? women still have to confront the cultural challenge of not feeling `` ashamed '' and bringing `` disrepute '' to their families while overcoming their fear of dealing with the police , who too often file complaints in the wrong categories to reduce the number of official cases on which their performance is judged . however , despite the barriers , two recent cases in india provide proof that even when the perpetrator is in a position of immense power , coming forward to report sexual harassment can make a difference . there is , for example , the young employee from an environmental research organization who alleged that her boss rajendra pachauri made unwelcome advances to her through text messages . her bold and persistent quest for justice resulted in pachauri stepping down from his position as chair of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change . pachauri denied the allegations and insisted his computer and phone were hacked . his counsel stated in court that pachauri 's inbox was not hacked , but he had shared the password with several people who could have sent inappropriate emails to the employee under his name . similarly , last year , tarun tejpal , founder of one of india 's leading media companies , was arrested for sexually assaulting his employee in an elevator . she first told her female editor who reportedly did not take her seriously . she then spoke about it to her male colleagues who encouraged her to report the incident to the police . tarun tejpal , who explained the incident as a `` bad lapse of judgment , '' was let out on interim bail while the case is still ongoing . women have allies -- both male and female -- who are willing to help clear the barriers . women everywhere just need to find the courage to speak up . the alternative to speaking out is a world where women feel less able to live full lives , restricted and disempowered . we can not accept harassment as part of our daily routine . we can not ignore it -- for our own sake and the next generation of women .u\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xff\\x18-lrb- cnn -rrb- this week 's attack on garissa university college is al-shabaab 's fifth major assault in kenya in the past year and a half . the thursday massacre was the most deadly assault so far , with 147 dead , easily eclipsing the terrorist group 's most notorious attack , a four-day siege in late september 2013 at the westgate mall in nairobi in which 67 people were killed . after the westgate attack , al-shabaab unleashed a string of attacks in kenya that have killed more than 100 people -- assaulting the coastal town of mpeketoni on june 16 , 2014 ; shooting bus passengers who could not recite the quran on november 22 , 2014 ; and then , days later , executing christian quarry laborers . why is al-shabaab , a somali nationalist , islamist group affiliated with al qaeda , targeting kenya ? al-shabaab says its attacks are to protest the more than 3,500 kenyan soldiers participating in the african union peacekeeping mission in somalia . but if that is the case , why does n't al-shabaab target kenyan military bases rather than attacking undefended so-called soft targets such as kenyan malls and universities ? in fact , thursday 's attack on the university is one more sign of the weakness of al-shabaab , which has steadily been losing ground for years in somalia as a result of the african union forces fighting them there , as well as a covert u.s. drone and special operations forces campaign that has also degraded the group 's capabilities . in 2006 , al-shabaab controlled the somali capital of mogadishu and , in the following years , much of central and southern somalia . six years later , african union forces had recaptured mogadishu , parts of southern somalia and critical cities such as kismayo . the loss of kismayo , al-shabaab 's last city stronghold and an important port , took a financial toll on the group . ground battles with african union forces have decimated al-shabaab 's rank-and-file , while u.s. drone strikes and special operations raids have killed some of the group 's leaders . in the past four years , according to a count by new america , the u.s. has launched a dozen drone strikes and six special operations raids against al-shabaab . these strikes and raids -- almost all occurring in southern somalia -- have targeted the terrorist group 's training camps and leaders . american drones or special operators have killed 10 leaders : aden hashi ayro , the top commander ; ahmed abdi godane , ayro 's successor ; a top commander , sheikh muhidin mohamud omar ; saleh ali saleh nabhan , a senior official who operated training camps ; commander jabreel malik muhammed ; bilal al-berjawi , the deputy of military leader fazul abdullah mohammed ; chief bomb-maker ibrahim ali abdi ; intelligence chief tahlil abdishakur ; yusef dheeq , the chief of external operations and planning for intelligence and security ; and adan garar , who was involved in planning the westgate mall attack . al-shabaab has been unraveling for years . thursday 's attack should remind the world that the group is a pale shadow of the organization that once dominated much of somalia but now is reduced to high profile attacks against undefended civilian targets .\\x9c\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf3$-lrb- the hollywood reporter -rrb- it may be time to light the lights . abc is filming a proof of concept for a revival of `` the muppets , '' the hollywood reporter has learned . `` the big bang theory '' co-creator bill prady is co-writing the script for a pilot presentation that sources say could be unspooled at may 's upfront presentation to madison avenue advertisers . sources tell thr that the project , if all goes well , could go straight to series . bob kushell -lrb- `` anger management , '' `` 3rd rock from the sun '' -rrb- will also co-write and is attached to serve as showrunner , with wilfred 's randall einhorn attached to exec produce and direct the presentation . abc 's `` muppets '' revival is being produced by abc studios and the muppet studios , which disney owns . the presentation is set to film next weekend on the disney lot in burbank with some of the original muppet performers returning . sources say the concept for the presentation includes the regular cast of characters created by jim henson -- kermit the frog , fozzie bear , gonzo and animal , among others -- gathering at abc studios for a meeting about the new `` muppet show . '' however , the show wo n't move forward unless miss piggy signs on , and her current relationship with frequent love kermit is on the rocks , preventing the show from getting off the ground . early plans call for two celebrity cameos -- including miss piggy 's current co-star -- as well as new roles including fozzie 's girlfriend and her parents . for prady , the revived `` muppets '' -- which landed at abc after initial interest from netflix -- marks a return to his roots . the producer , who currently does not have an overall deal , started his career working for henson in 1982 and ultimately started writing for `` the jim henson hour , '' remaining on the series until a year after henson 's death in 1990 . this marks the second time prady has attempted to revive `` the muppets . '' the writer-producer shot some test footage before cbs ' `` the big bang theory '' that disney ultimately passed on . for his part , prady earned an emmy nomination in 1991 for writing tribute `` the muppets celebrate jim henson '' in 1990 and has contributed writing to disney 's muppet-themed attractions . should abc order `` muppets '' to series , prady would juggle both that project and cbs ' `` the big bang theory , '' which he exec produces . created in 1955 by henson , the original muppet characters appeared on `` sam and friends '' from 1955-61 before going on to appear on late-night talk shows and commercials and becoming a regular part of `` sesame street '' in 1969 . `` the muppet show '' launched on its own as a comedy-variety series and ran from 1976-81 , with kermit serving as the de-facto showrunner on the syndicated series that was produced out of the u.k. . the franchise has spawned multiple movies -lrb- 1979 's `` the muppet movie , '' 1981 's `` the great muppet caper , '' 1984 's `` the muppets take manhattan '' -rrb- as well as nbc 's 1989 series `` the jim henson hour . '' following henson 's death , the franchise continued with `` muppets tonight '' airing on abc in 1996 with reruns airing on sibling disney channel from 1997-2000 . that was the last television series to feature the muppets characters . on the feature side , the franchise featured 1992 's `` the muppet christmas carol , '' 1996 's `` muppet treasure island '' and 1999 's `` muppets from space , '' the latter two of which were co-produced by disney , who acquired rights to the muppets in 2004 and formed the muppets studio . the company rebranded the franchise in 2008 with jason segel 's `` the muppets , '' with an eighth feature in the franchise , `` muppets most wanted '' bowing in 2014 . for abc , the muppets revival comes as variety shows are in the midst of a resurgence on the broadcast networks . nbc has made the format a priority , unspooling marlon wayans-hosted celebrity variety series `` i can do that ! '' in the summer and has neil patrick harris entry `` saturday night takeaway '' in the works . the decision to revive `` the muppets '' also comes as remakes and reboots are having their moment in the sun on the small-screen , as broadcast networks look to fan bases for existing franchises to help cut through the clutter and draw eyeballs in an increasingly crowded scripted space . on the comedy side , `` the muppets '' arrives as it has become increasingly challenging to launch original scripted half-hours . prady is repped by rothman brecher and lichter grossman ; kushell is with icm partners ; einhorn is with wme , odenkirk provissiero and bloom hergott . \\xc2\\xa9 2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .X\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xaf\\x1e-lrb- cnn -rrb- when etan patz went missing in new york city at age 6 , hardly anyone in america could help but see his face at their breakfast table . his photo 's appearance on milk cartons after his may 1979 disappearance marked an era of heightened awareness of crimes against children . on friday , more than 35 years after frenzied media coverage of his case horrified parents everywhere , a new york jury will again deliberate over a possible verdict against the man charged in his killing , pedro hernandez . he confessed to police three years ago . etan patz 's parents have waited that long for justice , but some have questioned whether that is at all possible in hernandez 's case . his lawyer has said that he is mentally challenged , severely mentally ill and unable to discern whether he committed the crime or not . hernandez told police in a taped statement that he lured patz into a basement as the boy was on his way to a bus stop in lower manhattan . he said he killed the boy and threw his body away in a plastic bag . neither the child nor his remains have ever been recovered . but hernandez has been repeatedly diagnosed with schizophrenia and has an `` iq in the borderline-to-mild mental retardation range , '' his attorney harvey fishbein has said . police interrogated hernandez for 7 1/2 hours before he confessed . `` i think anyone who sees these confessions will understand that when the police were finished , mr. hernandez believed he had killed etan patz . but that does n't mean he actually did , and that 's the whole point of this case , '' fishbein has said . but in november , a new york judge ruled that hernandez 's confession and his waiving of his miranda rights were legal , making the confession admissible in court . another man 's name has also hung over the patz case for years -- jose antonio ramos , a convicted child molester acquainted with etan 's babysitter . etan 's parents , stan and julia patz , sued ramos in 2001 . the boy was officially declared dead as part of that lawsuit . a judge found ramos responsible for the boy 's death and ordered him to pay the family $ 2 million -- money the patz family has never received . though ramos was at the center of investigations for years , he has never been charged . he served a 20-year prison sentence in pennsylvania for molesting another boy and was set to be released in 2012 . he was reportedly immediately rearrested upon exiting jail in 2012 on failure to register as a sex offender . since their young son 's disappearance , the patzes have worked to keep the case alive and to create awareness of missing children in the united states . in the early 1980s , etan 's photo appeared on milk cartons across the country , and news media focused in on the search for him and other missing children . `` it awakened america , '' said ernie allen , president and chief executive officer of the national center for missing & exploited children . `` it was the beginning of a missing children 's movement . '' the actual number of children who were kidnapped and killed did not change -- it 's always been a relatively small number -- but awareness of the cases skyrocketed , experts said . but the news industry was expanding to cable television , and sweet images of children appeared along with destroyed parents begging for their safe return . the fear rising across the nation sparked awareness and prompted change from politicians and police . in 1984 , congress passed the missing children 's assistance act , which led to the creation of the national center for missing & exploited children . former president ronald reagan opened the center in a white house ceremony in 1984 . it soon began operating a 24-hour toll-free hot line on which callers could report information about missing boys and girls . joe sterling and cnn 's lorenzo ferrigno contributed to this report .\\xa0\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xdb+-lrb- cnn -rrb- can you imagine paying $ 1,000 a month in rent to live in a one-car garage ? nicole , a 30-year-old woman , does n't have to imagine this scenario because it 's her everyday reality . the small and unusual living space is all that this employed , single mother can afford in her high-cost community in san mateo , california . nicole is n't alone in her struggles . cnn recently published a powerful piece called `` poor kids of silicon valley '' that documents the affordable housing challenges facing families in the bay area . one aspect featured a house that is home to 16 people , including 11 children . another chronicles a husband and wife named rich and stacey , both of whom have jobs , who are living in a san jose homeless shelter with their two kids because they do n't have the money to go anywhere else . although silicon valley has unique characteristics , it is n't the only community confronting these challenges . our entire nation is in the midst of an affordable housing crisis . the agency i lead , the u.s. department of housing and urban development , recently released a report estimating that 7.7 million low-income households live in substandard housing , spend more than half their incomes on rent or both . these are families who are dedicating $ 1 out of every $ 2 they earn just to keep a roof over their head . and the more they spend on housing , the less they have to invest in their children 's education , build up savings and shop at local businesses . these are outcomes that hurt our nation 's economy and require us to respond with swift and bold action . hud is working with local partners across the country to do just that . first , we 're focusing on preserving the affordable housing that already exists . since the mid-1970s , we have directed and insured loans for multifamily properties that have resulted in more than 700,000 affordable units . but by 2020 , we 're in danger of losing more than 125,000 because these mortgages are maturing , ending agreements to control rents in these units . so we 've launched a preservation effort with private partners to keep these properties affordable for generations to come . we 're also doing the same with public housing . right now , the nation is losing 10,000 units of public housing every year , mainly because of disrepair , hud created the rental assistance demonstration initiative to bring private investment into the fold for the public good . it 's cost neutral for the federal government and making a big impact for communities such as lexington , north carolina , where the local housing authority is making 58 years ' worth of repairs in just 22 months , including new lighting , modern windows and better insulation to help residents stay warm and cut energy costs . rad has allowed local communities to raise more than $ 733 million in new capital to date . that 's why we 're asking congress to give every community the chance to participate by lifting the restrictions on this program . no american should ever have to wait six decades to have a decent and healthy place to call home . in addition to preservation , hud is also working to create new affordable housing . a harvard study revealed that in 2012 , there were 11.5 million extremely low-income households and only 3.3 million affordable units available . it 's clear that we ca n't preserve our way out of this problem . we 've got to grow the supply to meet demand , so hud is taking a multifaceted approach . for example , our home investment partnerships program is leveraging $ 4 in private and other public resources for every $ 1 in home funds and leading to more than 1 million new and rehabilitated units for rent or sale to lower income families . this is more than just a statistic : it is progress for people , from the families living in the broadway crossing development in washington to the seniors living in the woodcrest retirement residence in pennsylvania . to keep this momentum going , we 've asked congress to increase home funding by 16 % to keep building affordable homes , prosperous partnerships and strong communities across the nation . we are also asking congress to expand our housing choice voucher program , which allows recipients of modest means , the elderly , and people with disabilities to find housing in the private market . this includes restoring 67,000 vouchers that were lost to sequestration . and we 're targeting our resources where they can have a big impact . for instance , hud awarded $ 94 million in targeted homelessness assistance to 274 programs across the san francisco bay area , including silicon valley , in january . and we continue to work with local partners to encourage private investment . to empower communities , president barack obama has also requested $ 300 million for new local housing policy grants to help them increase housing affordability , economic growth and access to jobs . all of this work is making a significant contribution to families and communities from coast-to-coast . our nation 's affordable housing challenges wo n't be solved overnight , and we still need to do more to make sure that more folks are able to prosper . let 's not squander this chance to make real progress for american families . incredible things can happen when a wide variety of leaders come together for the common good . by leveraging private investment and increasing collaboration with state , local and tribal governments and other traditional housing partners , i know we can build a future where affordable housing is available to all .g\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xae&-lrb- cnn -rrb- the public outrage over the `` religious freedom '' bills recently passed in arkansas and indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard , judging by their confused and contradictory responses . as poll watchers , they surely knew that most americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago . but the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses , including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality . they had better adjust to a new reality . for the past three decades , socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations , environmental initiatives and social welfare programs , while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in america 's population . for many , this alliance been puzzling : other , equally devout christians who place more emphasis on jesus christ 's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor , have been uncomfortable with it , as have many business leaders . their priorities , after all , are based on the bottom line . and companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line . hence , after indiana gov. mike pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples , the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift , from groups as diverse as the national collegiate athletic association , the indiana pacers , walmart , eli lilly , apple and even the marriott international hotel chain . marriott international was founded by j.w. marriott , a dedicated mormon , and is now run by his son bill , also a mormon who fully accepts his church 's teachings about traditional marriage . yet in june , marriott international launched a '' #love travels '' marketing campaign , aimed at attracting lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of `` the company 's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are . '' asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same-sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same-sex honeymooners , marriott pointed to the bible 's injunction of unconditional love , but added `` beyond that , i am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business . '' in 2014 , global spending by lgbt travelers was estimated at more than $ 200 billion , and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel . so marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome . businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias . a cnn poll taken in february found that 72 % of millennials nationwide believe that same-sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid . even among white evangelical protestants , 43 % of millennials support same-sex marriage , compared with less than 20 % of those their grandparents ' age , 68 and older . it used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts , but that is no longer possible . according to researchers for mtv 's `` look different '' anti-bias campaign , 90 % of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place , and almost 80 % say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias . so who 's the `` moral majority '' now ? for media-savvy millennials , following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it . in the first 24 hours after arkansas passed its version of the `` religious freedom '' bill , the twitter hashtag #boycottarkansas was used 12,000 times . it then snowballed after celebrity blogger perez hilton tweeted it to his 5.9 million twitter followers . america has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity , whether that pertains to race , ethnicity , gender or sexual orientation . since 2011 , the majority of children that have been born in the united states each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities . hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060 . women now lead men in educational attainment . and more than half of americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal . business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril .J\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

this month , she will need to make a choice about how much to highlight issues relating to economic inequality . former maryland gov. martin o'malley , who is also running for the democratic nomination , is trying to steal clinton 's thunder by talking about the problems of disproportionate wealth . in other words , there are many signs that democrats are planning to take on the big issue of economic inequality . but in other recent news , the likelihood that new york 's chuck schumer will replace harry reid as leader of the senate democrats means the dreams of a more economically leftward party are crashing into political reality . while schumer has been a very effective democrat and skilled legislative leader , he is also a wall street democrat who has spent much of his time courting and protecting powerful financial interests who run one of the dominant industries in his state . he is not alone . even at his most progressive moments , president barack obama relied on wall street donations for both of his campaigns . despite all the talk from conservatives about left-wing `` socialism '' in the white house , the financial community has been willing to open its coffers to democrats without much concern , even in the 2012 election . democratic populism ca n't really work within the current campaign finance system . the enormous pressures for parties to raise funds in campaigns has for many decades created pressure on democrats , despite their political base , to court big donors . during the 1980s , california democrat tony coelho , serving as the chairman of the democratic congressional campaign committee and then as majority whip , made a strong appeal to savings and loans executives before the crash of the industry to catch up to republicans who had been outflanking them in raising money . the democrats were , and have continued to , losing their traditional base of campaign support -- organized labor -- which had been a central source of campaign muscle since the 1930s , providing money and campaign assistance during campaigns . without organized labor to serve as their foundation and with the pressure for raising private funds increasing , many democrats concluded they needed business by their side . democrats running for president have made the same kind of choices . in 2008 , obama disappointed many supporters upon becoming the first president to abandon the post-watergate public finance system for campaigns altogether , preferring to raise money himself for the general campaign . while small donors were enormously important to his victories , so too were business and wall street executives . at the height of the financial crash , when public sentiment had clearly turned against wall street , the administration agreed to a financial regulation bill -lrb- dodd-frank -rrb- that was structured in such a way as to give powerful interests more than enough opportunity to limit the bite over the coming years . wall street , with an army of counsel , succeeded in eroding the impact of the legislation . not only does the acceptance of our campaign finance system limit the policy choices democrats can make , but it also greatly damages the party 's brand name . as the washington post reported , the scandal that might bring down new jersey democratic sen. robert menendez is the first involving large scale super pac donations . at the heart of the story is almost $ 600,000 that physician salomon melgen gave to senate majority pac , possibly in exchange for favors . this is not simply some sort of accommodation of democrats to the corporate system . they do n't have much of a choice . without these funds , they wo n't be able to compete . in this election cycle , independent campaign donors are causing a huge stir . in conservative circles , the koch brothers and their allies are throwing around enormous amounts of money to candidates who will support their deregulatory agenda . individual donors such as las vegas gambling magnate sheldon adelson are causing ripples every time candidates speak , pressuring them to adjust their agenda . democrats have found their own magnates for political support , such as tom steyer and george soros . this is why campaign finance reform is so important , without congress changing the fundamental dynamics , there wo n't be much room for populism to thrive . even if democrats select someone like a elizabeth warren as their candidate or hillary clinton decides to move sharply to the left on economic policy , there wo n't be much room for reform when the time of governance actually starts . the democratic party needs wall street more than it needs to take a stand against wall street . those are the facts on the ground . if democrats really want to take on wall street and tackle economic inequality , they first have to bring about reform of the campaign finance system . if campaigns were publicly funded or there were more stringent limits on independent expenditures , wall street would have much more trouble achieving disproportionate influence . reform could level the playing field . more often than not , campaign finance reform is an issue that gets sidetracked with little more than some pro forma words of support . a more populist economic agenda that revolved around progressive taxation and substantial public assistance to strengthen the middle class can only work in a different kind of political system . if things stay the same , democrats can only continue to win elections by turning to their corporate and financial base of support .\\xd7\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc71-lrb- cnn -rrb- a jury of rolling stone 's media peers has dissected the magazine 's disastrous , discredited story about rape on the campus of the university of virginia , and the emerging consensus is that rolling stone 's lapses and sloppy blunders amount to journalistic malpractice -- made all the worse by the magazine 's head-in-the sand reaction to the thorough , devastating report released by a panel of investigators from the columbia university graduate school of journalism . rolling stone 's egregious mistakes of reporting and editing are regrettable but understandable . the magazine 's decision not to fire anybody or reorganize its newsroom operation is not . before the original story , `` a rape on campus , '' was pulled from the rolling stone website , it registered 2.7 million hits following its publication in november -- more than any noncelebrity story in the magazine 's history . an anonymous undergraduate , given the name `` jackie , '' told rolling stone writer sabrina rubin erdely she had been invited to a party thrown by phi kappa psi fraternity in 2012 -- only to end up beaten and gang-raped by seven boys , who were allegedly coached along in the attack by the same student , a casual acquaintance , who had invited jackie to the party . the horrific allegations sparked protests against the fraternity , a police investigation , the temporary suspension of all fraternities at the school and a nationwide debate about the prevalence of sexual violence on college campuses . but the story began to unravel almost immediately when washington post reporter t. rees shapiro took a closer look , leading rolling stone to back away from the story and request a review by the columbia university graduate school of journalism . that review , which is considerably longer than the original article , reveals startling lapses in basic journalistic practice . rolling stone writer erdely never verified the identity of the attacker and therefore never confronted him with the allegations ; she never spoke to three of jackie 's friends who allegedly talked with jackie immediately after the attack , and she never gave the fraternity a fair chance to respond , refusing to provide specific information about what happened and when . and at every step of the way , when jackie began acting flaky -- refusing to provide basic information needed to verify her story or vanishing for weeks at a time without returning calls from the reporter -- neither erdely nor her editors or the magazine 's fact checkers made the hard but necessary decision to hit the pause button and decline to run the story . having worked part time as a journalism professor for a decade -lrb- including one semester at columbia -rrb- , i would agree with colleagues who call rolling stone 's lapses the kind that would be unacceptable in a freshman classroom . i 've told students for years : you should never print allegations without giving people a fair chance to respond . and you should never take a source 's word about important facts without verifying the truth . -lrb- there 's a reason we call it reporting and not dictation . -rrb- . most of all , i tell students , remember that you 're writing about human beings , who are complicated creatures : the good guys are never all that good , and the bad guys usually are n't completely bad . people can be mistaken or deceitful , i tell young reporters , they frequently forget and often lie to themselves . that does n't make a source useless , but it must make you extra careful . unfortunately , the early word from rolling stone is that they 've absorbed none of these lessons . publisher jann wenner has apparently decided not to fire , demote or discipline anybody at rolling stone , provoking expressions of disbelief among seasoned journalists . `` no one fired at rolling stone . really ? '' wrote cnn media critic brian stelter . `` what would rolling stone in its heyday write about an institution that screwed up unbelievably , damaged people 's lives , but punished no one ? '' tweeted john bresnahan , the capitol bureau chief of politico . `` rolling stone outsources its investigation to columbia and proceeds to do nothing in terms of individual accountability afterward ? ok ... , '' tweeted pundit joe concha . worse still , the editors who committed the blunder seem unprepared to revamp their operation to prevent a repeat of the debacle , framing the error as an earnest but misguided attempt to believe the word of a sexual assault victim . `` rolling stone 's senior editors are unanimous in the belief that the story 's failure does not require them to change their editorial systems , '' the columbia report says . and check out this amazing conclusion from will dana , the managing editor who presided over the disaster . dana told the columbia team : `` it 's not like i think we need to overhaul our process , and i do n't think we need to necessarily institute a lot of new ways of doing things . we just have to do what we 've always done and just make sure we do n't make this mistake again . '' that smug attitude pretty much ensures rolling stone 's newsroom managers will commit another goof in the future . at a minimum , they should heed the wise counsel of my friend bill grueskin , an executive editor at bloomberg who formerly served as dean of academic affairs at the columbia j-school . `` when doing big , investigative stories , reporters face many challenges : recalcitrant sources , complex numbers , buried records . editors , whose labors are usually cloaked in anonymity , are spared most of those hurdles . but they face their own internal newsroom challenges , particularly when handling a potential blockbuster story , '' grueskin writes . `` they must keep their star reporters happy , trim verbiage that interrupts the narrative , and deal with the expectations of bosses hungry for prizes and traffic . '' the problem could be , says grueskin , that rolling stone had too many chefs in the kitchen , instead of `` a single , talented editor with an intact set of vertebrae . '' until wenner and his team learn that basic lesson -- and revamp their hiring , editing and fact-checking process accordingly -- the rolling stone fiasco will eventually be followed by another , one made less forgivable because we all saw it coming .\\xfe\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' dumig met sahra through a photo workshop at refugio , a shelter in munich , germany , for refugees and torture victims . what drew dumig to sahra specifically was her strength and her ability to effectively reflect on all of her experiences . `` it really impressed me how she deals with everything , '' dumig said . `` she 's strong in her way of connecting with the culture here and also reflecting on what happened , the culture where she comes from . '' the number of refugees seeking asylum in the european union increased by 25 % last year , with germany receiving the most applications . one of the reasons dumig decided to photograph sahra is because growing up in germany made dumig realize that she lived a fortunate lifestyle . another reason has to do with dumig 's interest in people 's emotions and finding one 's identity . `` i realized so many people want to come to europe , and i always had the feeling to disappear or to go away , '' dumig said . `` seeing how people live in other parts of the world made me realize how privileged i am . '' `` apart together '' serves not only as a documentation of sahra , but as a far-reaching story about people from all backgrounds . the title of dumig 's work refers to the fact that although people may be physically apart from one another , the comparable feelings they experience are what link all people together . `` sometimes we feel strong , sometimes we feel lost -- that 's kind of universal , i think , '' dumig said . `` that 's why i want to universalize -lrb- sahra 's -rrb- story as well , not only make it about her . '' the underlying themes of `` apart together '' include the feelings of isolation and `` otherness '' and the search for a valuable human dignity . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` every one of these -lrb- refugees -rrb- have strong stories , and in the bureaucratic system , they are just a number or a document , '' dumig said . `` but they are a person , they are people with emotions and lives . '' sahra is currently under the status of `` suspension of deportation , '' meaning german immigration officials may grant her discretionary relief from deportation . dumig describes sahra as someone living through an unresolved situation . regardless of the challenges sahra faces as a refugee in germany , she is a survivor and the embodiment of resilience , determined to establish a new life for herself . she has learned to speak german fluently , and she has started working in the nation as well . like an unsolved photographic puzzle , each photo within `` apart together '' provides a piece of insight into sahra 's experiences . there is no certain and clear way in which to arrange the pieces , because they are a representation of the fragmented nature of sahra 's life . many of dumig 's photos are not of sahra herself , but instead show her surroundings . this makes `` apart together '' rich in symbolism and challenges viewers to develop their own perceptions . the photos are powerful because of this symbolic nature , as there are infinite interpretations attached to each one . `` i think everyone interprets by themselves , by however way they perceive it through their own experience . that 's up to the viewer , '' dumig said . `` it depends on who looks at the pictures . ... everyone will see something different . '' `` apart together '' allowed dumig to share various special moments with sahra , and they were both able to learn from each other . `` it was just something we both got something out of , '' dumig said . ines dumig is a photographer based in germany .L\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe80duhok , iraqi kurdistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- the children laugh and shriek , as some of them seem to always have the capacity to do no matter how depressing the circumstances . their bright clothes provide splashes of color against the otherwise drab monotone white of the endless rows of tents . a small group plays with rocks , replacements for the toys they left behind when they fled , while others clamber through a jagged tear in the wire fence surrounding the refugee camp . the shariya refugee camp opened around six months ago , made up of some 4,000 tents and counting . thousands of yazidis now call this corner of iraqi kurdistan home , about 18 miles -lrb- 30 kilometers -rrb- from one of the front lines with isis , where one can hear the occasional reverberation in the distance of what we are told are airstrikes . the vast majority of the camp 's occupants are from the town of sinjar , which is near the border with syrian kurdistan , and fled the isis assault there back in august . but not everyone escaped . isis took thousands of yazidis captive . the fighters separated the young women and girls , some as young as 8 years old , to be sold as slaves , for their `` masters '' to use as concubines . men faced a choice : convert to islam or be shot . mahmoud was out running errands when isis fighters arrived , taking his wife , ahlam , their three children -- the youngest of which was just a month old -- and his elderly parents . `` they took our phones , jewelry , money , '' ahlam recalls . `` they had guns . they forced us at gunpoint into big trailer trucks . '' they were taken to a school turned prison in tal afar . from there , the family was moved from village to village -- and at one stage taken to mosul . `` they wrote everyone 's name down and they asked where we want to work , in the fields , as cleaners or as herders , '' she says . ahlam and her family chose to herd goats . they were then taken to a shia village whose residents had fled , where they were part of a group of around 40 living in one house . in the home , ahlam found a cell phone left behind by its former occupants and called her husband . `` i said we are alive but we are prisoners . '' ahlam 's husband , who up until that moment had lost the will to live , thinking his family was dead , says he cried out of happiness despite his pain . ahlam would call when she could , briefly , after midnight , hiding under her bedcovers . if she was caught with a phone , she would be killed . the village itself was a massive prison , its entrances guarded by isis fighters . she recalls that two men , in their late 40s or 50s , tried to escape . when they were caught , their bones were broken , their bodies tied to the back of a truck and then driven through the streets . the yazidi captives were forced to watch the gruesome spectacle . the men 's corpses were then tossed into a ditch and an order given not to bury them . one night , some of the yazidi men risked their lives to toss dirt onto the bodies , to give those slain what dignity they could . ahlam tells us that about a week before we met , isis fighters came by and took away her in-laws and the other elderly people living in the house . `` we did n't know where they were taking them , we thought we would be next , '' she remembers . so she and the rest of the group realized that they had to try to flee . `` we decided that either we survive or we do n't . '' they left at midnight . ahlam cradled the baby , as her two other children , ages 3 and 4 years old , clutched at her clothes . she prayed the baby would n't cry , that the children could keep walking . they knew the general direction to take , but not the exact route , and they could only hope it was toward freedom . `` when the sun started to come up , i thought that 's it , we are going to get caught , '' ahlam says . `` and what am i going to do with the kids ? i ca n't carry all three of them and run . '' luckily , ahlam never had to answer that impossible question . the group made it into iraqi kurdistan . the couple ca n't put into words their emotions when they were reunited . mahmoud , gently caressing his daughter 's palm , says he could hardly believe that the woman whose stunning eyes and gentle words he had fallen in love with , and their three children , were by his side again . it had been eight agonizing months . but their joy was tainted by fear for mahmoud 's parents . a few days after mahmoud and ahlam were reunited , isis released 217 captives . no one is disclosing exactly why . among them were 60 children , a handful of men and women , and the rest were elderly -- including mahmoud 's parents . `` we did n't know if they were going to slaughter us or what they were going to do with us , '' mahmoud 's father says . `` they moved us around a lot , and at one stage we stayed in in one place for three days . '' but ahlam 's parents are still with isis . vian dakhil , a yazidi member of iraq 's parliament , speculates that the yazidis isis released are individuals they were struggling to care for . dakhil is part of iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi 's delegation to the united states this week . she will be addressing the united nations -- pleading for more international support for iraq and more airstrikes to help defeat isis -- and she will address the plight of the yazidis . `` we sometimes say that we wish we had been massacred . this would be better than being kidnapped and raped . we prefer death now over the fate of what is happening to these girls and women , '' dakhil says . `` it is now on the government and on the international community to focus on this . how to get these captives back . it 's inconceivable that in the 21st century , something like this is happening as if we were living in the stone age . '' ahlam says she was spared because she was breastfeeding and she had young children , which , we 're told , makes her impure and therefore unable to be used as a sex slave . for ahlam , what she went through was not the hardest part of her ordeal . it 's the moment when the isis fighters began taking away the girls and young women . she 's haunted by their screams , the image of them being dragged away sobbing and screaming .\\xf4\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' doyne called her parents and asked them to wire her the $ 5,000 she had earned babysitting . in 2006 , she purchased land in surkhet , a district in western nepal . she worked for two years with the local community to build the kopila valley children 's home . today , kopila -- which means `` flower bud '' in nepali -- is home to about 50 children , from infants to teenagers . doyne started the blinknow foundation to support and grow her efforts . in 2010 , the group opened its kopila valley school , which today educates more than 350 students . doyne lives in nepal year-round , traveling to the u.s. a few times a year . see more cnn heroes . the cnn heroes team traveled to surkhet and talked to doyne about her work and the community she supports . below is an edited version of their conversation . cnn : how does it work , raising nearly 50 kids ? maggie doyne : it 's communal living , for sure ! we 're a family of almost 50 kids ages 8 months to 16 years . everybody just pitches in and helps each other . they all have their chores . they all have their duties . and everybody cooks the meals together and makes sure that they do their part to make the home run smoothly . the staff at the home , we call them the aunties and the uncles . we wake up in the morning and go off to school . and then come home and do homework and eat our meals together , and everybody goes to bed at night . cnn : how does a child come to live in your home ? doyne : our first priority as an organization is to keep a child with their family if at all possible . in order to come into the home , you need to have lost both parents , or in some rare cases have suffered extreme neglect , abuse or have a parent who 's incarcerated . we have to conduct a full investigation . so usually that involves going to the child 's village , making calls , doing police checks , getting documentation and paperwork . we have to dig up birth certificates , death certificates , make sure that everything lines up the way that they say it does . cnn : meanwhile , you have 350 children attending your school . what is their background ? doyne : every single year we 'll get from 1,000 to 1,500 applicants . and we choose the ones who are the most needful and really wo n't be in school without us . most of them live in one room , a mud hut . a lot of them are just in survival mode . we try to relieve the burden from the family , so that the child has food , medical care , books , zero fees for education . cnn : what have you learned working with the local community in nepal ? doyne : i learned very early on , from the beginning , that i could n't come in and just be like , `` here , i have a vision . this is what we 're going to do . '' that does n't work . it has to be slow ; it has to be organic . and it has to come from the community and be a `` we '' thing . it 's really important to me that this is a nepali project , working for nepal , for the community . so the faces that you see are strong nepali women and amazing nepali role-model men . cnn : how does the project continue to grow ? doyne : we started with the home and then school . we run the school lunch program . then we needed to keep our kids really healthy , so we started a small clinic and then a counseling center . from there we started getting more sustainable and growing our own food . and then from there we decided to start a women 's center . we just bought a new piece of property to create a totally green and sustainable off-the-grid campus . this year we converted to solar energy . so we 'll have a high school and then a day care , preschool , elementary , all the way up , and a vocational center where kids can become a thriving young adult with everything they need to succeed moving forward . it 's become so much more than just a little girl with a backpack and a big dream . it 's become a community . and i want to teach and have other people take this example and hope this sets a precedent for what our world can be and look like . want to get involved ? check out the blinknow foundation website at www.blinknow.org and see how to help .|\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' zacharia yusuf abdurahman , 19 ; adnan farah , 19 ; hanad mustafe musse , 19 ; and guled ali omar , 20 , were arrested in minneapolis . abdirahman yasin daud , 21 , and mohamed abdihamid farah , 21 , were arrested in san diego after driving there in hopes of crossing into mexico , luger said . they plotted for 10 months , luger said . `` even when their co-conspirators were caught and charged , they continued to seek new and creative ways to leave minnesota to fight for a terror group . '' another friend , who was part of the group , changed his mind and became a cooperating witness for the fbi , even tape recording some meetings , luger said . the fbi investigation has previously netted abdullahi yusuf , who has pleaded guilty to conspiring to provide material support to isis , and hamza ahmed , who has been indicted on charges of conspiring and attempting to provide material support to isis and is now pending trial , according to the criminal complaint . the complaint describes a man , identified only as `` nur , '' who has spent time in syria and allegedly helped the six accused men . four of the men who were arrested appeared in federal court on monday but did not enter a plea . the judge ordered they all be held without bail , and a detention hearing was scheduled for wednesday . cnn 's tony marco contributed to this report .\\xd3\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the dancer did not pursue a case against the bolshoi . when she left the bolshoi in 2013 , womack joined the kremlin ballet theatre where she still works , aged 20 , as a principal ballerina ; dancing close to the russian president 's office , next to the cathedrals inside the red walls of the kremlin . the surroundings may be opulent but her pay packet is not : for her role as a principal dancer womack says she is paid around $ 240 a month -- which works out at around $ 8 a day . the dancer says the amount of money she makes in dollars each month has fallen as the russian ruble has weakened -- the currency has suffered , in part , from a low oil price and international sanctions imposed on russia over its annexation of crimea last year . womack says a friend helps her with accommodation and she says she has to make the money stretch in order to buy food . `` for anyone paid a salary in rubles , especially since the crisis , it is extremely difficult . you have to decide what is worth more for you - experience or financial stability . i 'm at a point in my life where experience is worth more . '' sitting in the wings of the stage , chatting in russian to the other dancers and stretching before her rehearsal for swan lake , she says she has to make the $ 185 in her bank account last for the next few weeks . to earn extra money she dances bigger roles or takes part in events abroad . the kremlin ballet theatre says womack 's salary corresponds to her job title as a principal dancer and that , `` on average , the salary -lsb- principal -rsb- dancers are paid is significantly higher '' than $ 240 a month but that womack could have been paid that equivalent in dollars `` depending on the exchange rate on the day and depending on how much she danced in productions the previous month . '' as an american , womack says she is paid the same as her contemporaries and is treated just like the russians . but she says that is not always the case offstage . `` it 's extremely difficult to watch the deteriorating relationships between the united states and russia . the great thing about working for a russian company is that we are focused on creating art but ... outside the ballet world it is difficult for foreigners ; the general tendency tends to be more nationalistic and they unfortunately judge foreigners by their cover . '' although relations between the u.s. and russia have taken a nosedive since russia 's annexation of crimea last march , womack says she is `` very loyal '' to the kremlin ballet theatre . `` i love the russian system and i 'm very patriotic in that sense , '' she says . and despite the political situation -- and the money -- she says , `` russia has a lot to offer , it is a beautiful place that creates stars and that itself is worth investing one 's career in .\\xd0\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the lawsuit alleges the rockefeller foundation funded johns hopkins ' research into public health issues , including venereal disease , and employed scientists who monitored the guatemala experiments . the lawsuit , the rockefeller foundation statement said , `` seeks improperly to assign ` guilt by association ' in the absence of compensation from the united states federal government . '' the suit says johns hopkins and the rockefeller foundation designed , supported and benefited from the guatemala experiments . bristol-myers squibb pharmaceutical group and that company 's owner , mead johnson , also are defendants . the pharmaceutical company supplied drugs for the experiments , the suit says . on saturday , a spokeswoman for bristol-myers squibb sent this statement to cnn : `` we 've only just received the complaint in this matter . bristol-myers squibb played an important role in the development of penicillin in the past and today we continue to focus our work on developing breakthrough medicines for serious disease . as a company dedicated to patients , we take this matter very seriously and are reviewing the allegations . '' nobody doubts the experiments happened . in 2010 , then-secretary of state hillary clinton apologized to guatemala for the experiments , saying they were `` clearly unethical . '' in the 1930s and 1940s , the government followed a policy of funding scientific medical research but not controlling individual doctors , the suit says . the lawsuit says john hopkins controlled and influenced the appointed panels that authorized funding for research into venereal disease . the lawsuit says prostitutes were infected to intentionally spread the disease and that syphilis spirochetes were injected into the spinal fluid of subjects . a woman in a psychiatric hospital had gonorrhea pus from a male subject injected into both her eyes , the suit says . the lawsuit does n't say why the experiments ended . the results were never published and were not revealed until 2011 , when the presidential commission for the study of bioethical issues wrote a letter to president barack obama telling of its investigation , the suit says . cnn 's deanna hackney contributed to this report .*\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' police appear on video saying , `` f*ck your breath , '' apparently in response . sheriff stanley glanz did n't specify the nature of the threats , but said he was `` very concerned '' for their safety and that of their families . he did not say what the deputies had been assigned to do . another sheriff 's official said the office has temporarily suspended operations of the agency 's drug unit pending the review of the april 2 shooting of harris following a weapons sting . glanz indicated he has not yet decided how to proceed with a review of their actions , saying any action may be delayed until after the court case involving bates has been settled . bates is charged with second-degree manslaughter in harris ' death . bates , who is free on $ 25,000 bond pending trial , shot harris with his handgun after calling out , `` taser , taser , '' -- an indication he planned to use a stun gun to subdue harris following a brief foot chase with the other deputies . amid questions about his age -- 73 -- training and friendship with glanz , bates has said the shooting was accidental , and has apologized to the family . lawyer releases training records for tulsa deputy charged in killing . on monday , glanz also apologized to harris ' family . `` we are sorry eric was taken from you , '' he said . but he said his office holds itself to the highest national standards of policing , and said monday that the fbi had cleared the agency of any civil rights violations in the shooting . bates is white . harris was black . there have been allegations , first reported by the tulsa world newspaper , that some of bates ' training records had been forged , or that he was unqualified to be serving on the force . the sheriff denied those allegations , saying he was certain bates had qualified on the gun range and had extensive additional training . he said he was unaware of any forgery involving training records , and said he had not issued any training waivers for bates , with whom he has been friends for more than two decades . but he said he supported prosecutor 's decision to proceed with the case . he also said he had brought in a dallas police consultant who had previously examined the office 's policies and procedures for another look . harris ' family has said the shooting reveals `` a deep-seated problem '' within the department and has demanded justice , and changes in policy .*\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb4(-lrb- cnn -rrb- the jailing of four blackwater security guards , eight years after they killed 17 iraqi civilians in a shooting in baghdad , is a positive step for justice -- but is also not enough . the kind of horror represented by the blackwater case and others like it -- from abu ghraib to the massacre at haditha to cia waterboarding -- may be largely absent from public memory in the west these days , but it is being used by the islamic state in iraq and syria -lrb- isis -rrb- to support its sectarian narrative . in its propaganda , isis has been using abu ghraib and other cases of western abuse to legitimize its current actions in iraq as the latest episodes in over a decade of constant `` sunni resistance '' to `` american aggression '' and to `` shiite betrayal '' -- as phrased in an isis publication from late 2014 titled `` the revived caliphate , '' which chronicles the rise of isis since 2003 . as the iraqi government today struggles to regain the support of sunnis in its fight against isis -- or even renew intra-sunni trust -- this invocation of american transgressions by isis should be a sobering reminder of the importance of good governance in the pursuit of a solution to the unrest in iraq . the lack of accountability in the aftermath of the american intervention in iraq not only paved the way for abuses like abu ghraib and blackwater , it also fuelled sectarian tension in the country -- and today isis is reaping the benefits . the u.s. poured money into iraq after the 2003 invasion , but it did not make this support contingent upon a fair distribution of power and resources by the iraqi government . this enabled the shiite-dominated government of former prime minister nuri al-maliki to discriminate against the sunni community . the united states was also sloppy in relying on private security firms like blackwater without implementing rigorous measures to regulate their behavior . it also turned a blind eye to the way its own troops were treating iraqis . all those factors contributed to a rising sense of injustice that is now being conveniently packaged by isis to push its own version of iraqi history . in `` the revived caliphate , '' abu ghraib is invoked three times as the place where iraqi sunnis who resisted the u.s. ended up as a result of their betrayal by shiites who collaborated with the americans . the publication first recounts attacks on abu ghraib at the height of the american intervention by al qaeda in iraq -lrb- aqi -rrb- -- isis ' predecessor -- to free imprisoned `` sunnis '' who had been detained by the americans . it then presents the sahwa -lrb- awakening -rrb- of 2007 -- when sunni tribes collaborated with the u.s. to fight aqi -- as a case of intra-sunni resentment that led the tribes to hand over aqi members `` to the americans , where they were put through severe torture in the likes of the prisons of abu ghraib , '' according to the publication . it then links those two stories to the storming of the prison by isis in 2013 to free those who had been tortured by `` the americans and shi'a '' -lrb- as the publication puts it -rrb- over ten years . in bridging a decade of history and in placing the shiites squarely in the category of `` enemy , '' isis is sending a strong message that its current fight in iraq is about reversing longstanding injustices against sunnis and restoring a sense of sunni belonging under the umbrella of the `` caliphate . '' the civilians killed by the blackwater guards , like the abu ghraib prisoners , were both sunni and shiite . but the repackaging of history by isis -- in which the saddam hussein regime is reinvented as a `` sunni '' regime that tried to stand up to the united states and its shiite allies -- glosses over those nuances . the reproduced images of abu ghraib prisoners in the aforementioned isis publication , juxtaposed with images of civilian deaths as a result of u.s. airstrikes against isis targets , are presented as `` proof '' of the group 's narrative . and they are reinforced with text that frames america today as `` the air force of the shi'a . '' it is becoming clear that isis can not be defeated in iraq without buy-in from the country 's sunnis . without sunni help , isis will continue to frame the conflict as one where sunnis are once again being attacked by the u.s. and the shiites -- particularly as shiite militias have become a key part of the fight against the terror group in places like tikrit . to balance out this shiite involvement , the u.s. and iraqi governments are counting on the establishment of a cross-sectarian iraqi national guard , and hoping to resurrect the `` awakening '' to re-engage and unify the sunnis under a nationalist umbrella . but those plans will not succeed unless serious steps are taken to ensure that good governance measures are in place to hold both iraqis and all those affiliated with the anti-isis coalition to account . this should not just apply in the context of the current conflict -- so that scenarios like abu ghraib and blackwater are not repeated -- but also when the dust settles . good governance is the most effective antidote to sectarianism .\\x94\\x1f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x95=-lrb- cnn -rrb- debates on climate change can break down fairly fast . there are those who believe that mankind 's activities are changing the planet 's climate , and those who do n't . but a new way to talk about climate change is emerging , which shifts focus from impersonal discussions about greenhouse gas emissions and power plants to a very personal one : your health . it 's easy to brush aside debates involving major international corporations , but who would n't stop to think -- and perhaps do something -- about their own health , or the health of their children ? this new way of talking about climate change -- and linking it to public health issues -- was part of a roundtable discussion tuesday at howard university 's college of medicine . president barack obama joined u.s. surgeon general dr. vivek murthy and epa administrator gina mccarthy for a roundtable discussion on the topic as part of national public health week . `` i think we 've always known -- or at least in the 20th century we 've understood -- that environment has an impact on public health , '' the president told cnn 's dr. sanjay gupta . `` i remember when i first went to college in los angeles in 1979 , the air was so bad that you could n't go running outside , '' obama said . `` you 'd have air quality alerts , and people who had respiratory problems or were vulnerable had to stay inside . we took action , and the air 's a lot better . '' `` there are a whole host of public health impacts that are going to hit home , so we 've got to do better in protecting vulnerable americans , '' obama continued . `` ultimately , though , all of our families are going to be vulnerable . you ca n't cordon yourself off from air or climate . '' murthy revealed to the group that asthma is a personal issue for him , as a favorite uncle died from a severe attack when he was younger . `` it 's also personal to me because i 've cared for many patients over the years who have suffered from asthma and have seen firsthand how frightening it can be to suddenly be wheezing and fighting for every breath , '' murthy said . `` asthma can be very difficult for patients , but also for their families . the impacts of climate change could make the situation worse . '' `` this is not just a future threat -- this is a present threat , '' said brian deese , a senior adviser to the president . deese cited a recent study by the american thoracic society that found seven out of 10 doctors reported climate change is contributing to more health problems among their patients . `` the good news is that , in addition to having doctors and nurses , public health officials , schools of medicine joining together to raise awareness -- and to in some cases impact their practice -- they anticipate , for example , increased asthma instances , and plan ahead of time to deal with those , '' obama told gupta . `` what we have is companies like google and microsoft that are going to take data we 're releasing and start developing apps so that , potentially , individual families are going to be able to monitor the air quality in their communities in a real-time basis . '' `` communities can start planning for prevention and mitigation efforts more effectively , and hopefully the other thing that happens is that families and parents join with these doctors and nurses to start putting some pressure on elected officials to try to make something happen to reduce the impacts of climate change , '' said obama . the impacts of climate change on health will depend on a multitude of factors , according to the environmental protection agency . `` these factors include the effectiveness of a community 's public health and safety systems to address or prepare for the risk and the behavior , age , gender , and economic status of individuals affected , '' the epa says on its website . `` impacts will likely vary by region , the sensitivity of populations , the extent and length of exposure to climate change impacts , and society 's ability to adapt to change . '' the world health organization estimates climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 . `` most will likely perish from malaria , diarrhea , heat exposure and under-nutrition . '' `` around the world , variations in climate are affecting , in profoundly diverse ways , the air we breathe , the food we eat , and the water we drink , '' writes dr. maria neira , director of the who 's public health and environment department . `` we are losing our capacity to sustain human life in good health . '' `` consider air pollution , the single greatest environmental health risk we face . in 2012 alone , exposure to indoor and outdoor pollutants killed more than 7 million people -- one in eight deaths worldwide . under-nutrition already accounts for 3 million deaths each year in the world 's poorest regions . rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patters are expected to reduce crop yields , further compromising food security . floods are increasing in frequency and intensity , creating breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects . mosquito-borne diseases , like malaria , are particularly sensitive to heat and humidity . what will happen if rising temperatures accelerate the lifecycle of the malaria parasite ? '' `` children and the elderly will be among the most vulnerable , '' writes neira . `` areas with health infrastructure will be least able to cope . developing countries will be hardest hit . the health gaps we have been trying hard to close may grow even wider . '' earth 's average temperature has risen by 1.4 degrees fahrenheit over the past century , and is projected to rise an additional 2 degrees over the next hundred years , according to the epa . `` small changes in the average temperature of the planet can translate to large and potentially dangerous shifts in climate and weather , '' the agency warns . `` many places have seen changes in rainfall , resulting in more floods , droughts , or intense rain , as well as more frequent and severe heat waves . '' still , there exists a sizable group of people who doubt climate change is happening . `` although climate scientists have been in the news describing this winter as a strong signal that global warming is producing extreme weather , americans are no more likely today -lrb- 55 % -rrb- than in the past two years to believe the effects of global warming are occurring , '' according to a march gallup poll . a 2013 time magazine article makes the case that medical professionals may be the best messengers for global warming . `` framing global warming as a public health issue rather than as an environmental or national security one produces the most emotionally compelling response among people , since it focuses on the immediate implications a warmer climate would have on people 's lives , '' the article says . `` this strategy also has the benefit of providing a sense of hope that the problems can be addressed and avoided , if action is taken early enough . '' the president said what happened with los angeles ' air proved that point . `` when the clean air act was passed , not only was there a terrible smog in los angeles , it was true in most metropolitan areas across the country , '' obama said . `` the fact is that air quality has dramatically improved and it 's been much cheaper than anybody expected , because technology advanced and people figured out how to do it . as a consequence , the american people are a lot healthier , in addition to being able to , you know , see the mountains in the background because it 's not covered in smog . '' `` we know how to do this , '' obama said . `` we just have to be bold and recognize and trust the kind of innovative spirit that the american people have always displayed .

      "b\"\\x82--lrb- cnn -rrb- on the surface , the mix-up seems incomprehensible : how can a volunteer sheriff 's deputy accidentally fire a handgun instead of a taser , killing a man ? that 's apparently what happened in tulsa , oklahoma , when a 73-year-old reserve deputy , robert bates , killed eric harris . bates said he meant to use his stun gun but ended up firing his handgun instead . `` oh ! i shot him . i 'm sorry , '' bates said in a video of the shooting . but it 's happened before . in a well-publicized 2009 case , a bay area rapid transit police officer fired his gun instead of his taser , killing 22-year-old oscar grant in oakland , california . the former officer , johannes mehserle , testified that he had meant to use his taser but drew his gun instead . mehserle was sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter but was released early due to good conduct . so how easy -- or hard -- is it to draw and fire a handgun mistakenly instead of a taser ? here are some factors to consider : . law enforcement experts say the gun should be holstered on the officer 's dominant side of the body , and the taser should be placed on the nondominant side . so if an officer is left-handed , the gun should be on the left side . bates ' attorney said his client is left-handed . but the reserve deputy said his gun was holstered on his right side -- his nondominanant side . `` i shoot long guns left handed and handguns right handed , '' bates said in a written statement to investigators . after bates announced at the scene he was going to use his taser , he `` used his nondominant hand , and it was the gun , '' said clark brewster , bates ' attorney . `` he said that he saw the laser sight on the shoulder , assumed it was the taser , '' brewster said . `` both the gun and the taser have a laser sight , and he just made a mistake . '' brewster also said his client 's left hand was holding a pepper gun . in his statement to investigators , bates said he had grabbed a `` pepper ball launcher '' to try to slow or stop harris , who was running away . bates did not say explicitly where the taser was on his body . but he admitted to grabbing the wrong device and said he was `` startled '' by the recoil of the gun . `` after realizing what had happened i was in a state of shock and disbelief , '' he told investigators . bates is now charged with second-degree manslaughter . if convicted , he faces up to four years in prison . deputy who shot eric harris turns himself in . bates was carrying his personal gun , a smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolver , and a model x26 taser , he said in his statement to investigators . attorneys representing the harris family said there are stark differences between the two devices . one held up a small black .357 revolver , followed by a mostly bright yellow taser that was noticeably larger than the gun . `` there 's no way an officer can get this confused with this , '' said one of the attorneys from the law firm of smolen , smolen & roytman . taser 's x26 model comes in different designs . some are mostly yellow , while others are mostly black with a yellow panel in the middle . but all appear to be larger than smith & wesson .357 five-shot revolvers . sgt. jim clark of the tulsa police department -- which is separate from the county sheriff 's office for which bates volunteered -- said bates was the `` victim '' of something called `` slip and capture . '' that 's when a person intends to do one thing but instead does another in a high-stress situation . but a criminal justice expert told cnn the claim amounts to `` junk science . '' `` there 's no peer-reviewed articles that would support this . ... it 's not generally accepted by the scientific community , '' said phil stinson , an assistant professor of criminal justice at bowling green state university . `` so it 's something that in most courts would not be admissible as evidence . '' an attorney for the harris family said the `` slip and capture '' theory has n't held up in court . `` the only time slip and capture has ever been used as a defense was in the shooting in oakland -lrb- of oscar grant -rrb- , '' the attorney said . and that defense failed . tasers are built to feel and look different than guns , according to taser international . steve tuttle , vice president for strategic communications at taser , noted some of those differences to cnn : a gun is heavier . a taser has a different grip and feel . when you take the safety off on a taser , an led control panel lights up . there 's more : tasers can be different colors -lrb- yellow or black -rrb- , and the holster is different from a gun 's . but in the field , where an officer reacts on instinct , there are other distinctions outside of the product itself that are important , tuttle said . taser 's training calls for the stun gun to be placed on an officer 's nondominant side , as law enforcement experts say . and its training suggests that officers shout aloud , `` taser ! taser ! taser ! '' as they prepare to deploy it . these guidelines are designed so that in the moment -- when an officer 's muscle memory kicks in -- the body reflexively knows which weapon it is reaching for . it is up to each law enforcement department , however , in how it trains personnel and what regulations it requires as far as placement on the body . the company declined to comment on the tulsa shooting in particular . the stun guns , or conducted electrical weapons , manufactured by taser have been used more than 2.7 million times , tuttle said , and are designed to be used in situations that are not considered life or death . cnn 's catherine e. shoichet , brooke baldwin , ed lavandera and mariano castillo contributed to this report .\\xea\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the governor 's office said the first alternative for execution is lethal injection , followed by nitrogen gas , the electric chair and the firing squad . \\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xcb/-lrb- cnn -rrb- there are two paths to practicing medicine in america . there 's the traditional , time-tested way , where new doctors graduate from medical school and then pass a series of national exams while training for years as resident physicians . then there 's the approach being forged in florida and arizona : getting elected to a state legislature . lawmakers in those states are too often donning the white coats to orchestrate medical practice . in 2011 , florida enacted the firearm owners ' privacy act , which threatens prosecution and loss of licensure for any physicians who dare ask their patients about gun ownership and gun safety . guns are a scientifically uncontested health risk . asking about them is standard practice in pediatrics and psychiatry . i treat brain injuries , and it 's part of my job to talk with patients about things that might be unsafe for them , like driving . and handling weapons . some of those i treat suffered their injuries by bullets , typically fired by family members or themselves . does anyone really believe i should n't talk about gun safety in these cases ? it 's a good thing i do n't practice in florida . florida 's gun censorship law was dragged into court soon after the governor signed it , and while a three-judge appeals panel upheld the law last summer , doctors can still ask about guns while the full 11th circuit court of appeals decides whether it will take up the case , a decision that could come down any day , the president of the florida chapter of the american academy of pediatrics , dr. tommy schechtman , told me . he is a plaintiff in the case . in arizona , another assault on physician free speech is scheduled to go into effect this summer . bill 1318 goes a step beyond silencing doctors . it requires them to lie . the bill was originally a hum-drum attempt to block health plans from covering abortion services , a common state and federal strategy . but legislators slid in a last-minute provision mandating that physicians who prescribe the abortion pill ru-486 tell patients the pill is reversible . that 's the opinion of a particular san diego doctor who says this can be done through risky , large doses of progesterone . but the doctor has n't proven his case , and his regimen is not recommended by the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists or the food and drug administration . any doctor is certainly within his or her rights to review the limited information available about the san diego regimen and decide whether to discuss it with patients , but actually requiring physicians to make claims most believe to be untrue and unsafe means the legislators are overstepping their bounds and interfering with the patient-doctor relationship . i can not imagine anyone attempting to put words into the mouth of a lawyer privately consulting with a client . why are physicians putting up with a professional assault the american bar association would never permit ? dr. ilana addis , chairwoman of the arizona chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists , told me the amendment was added shortly before she was scheduled to testify about the bill before the arizona house . while planned parenthood and the aclu joined her organization in criticizing the provision , the bill passed both chambers and was recently signed by the governor . there 's a common relationship shared by these laws , beyond turning doctors into government spokespeople . these laws capitalize on controversial issues to divide and conquer . physicians do n't all share the same opinions on abortion and guns any more than they all vote republican or democrat . this is part of the reason the key state physicians ' associations are n't taking the lead in battling these laws . the battle is left to the specialties most affected . in florida , that 's the state 's chapter of the american academy of pediatrics , since pediatricians are most likely to ask about guns in the home . in arizona , it 's the state chapter of the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists carrying the torch for physician free speech . the florida medical association did n't provide me with details about whether it has a lobbying effort against the gun law , and the arizona medical association told me in a statement that `` arma 's policy is to take no position on abortion . '' representing physicians as a whole , the state medical associations have the most political clout in statehouses . the massachusetts medical society -lrb- mss -rrb- tried to utilize that power recently when it decided to dedicate `` doctor 's day '' to the issue of physician free speech , highlighting the threat posed by florida 's gun law in particular . members are concerned about the precedent being set . arkansas enacted a law similar to arizona just days later . the american medical association can do more . it did file a friend-of-the-court brief as part of the florida legal challenge , but at this writing has n't weighed in on arizona . the ama did n't sign on to a statement released last week by the coalition to protect the patient-provider relationship that hits hard on the new abortion laws as an affront to good medical care . its huge lobbying operations are tied up in washington , while states are the main battleground over the integrity of medical practice . now that the ama has won the age-old `` doc fix '' battle , ending automatic medicare payment cuts to doctors , perhaps it will consider assigning some of its $ 18 million lobbying team to stand in for lackluster state affiliates who 've abdicated their responsibility to vigorously defend the medical profession . we have a surgeon general now , vivek murthy , and he is on a national listening tour while he prepares to announce his areas of policy focus on april 22 , jonathan beeton , a health and human services spokesman told me . i hope murthy will see beyond the bluster of abortion and gun politics and zero in on a key issue affecting public health -- free and unfettered communication between patients and doctors .\\xc8\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbe)-lrb- cnn -rrb- recently , robert kennedy jr. was in sacramento , california , to campaign against senate bill 227 , which makes it harder for parents to opt out of vaccinations . in his remarks at an anti-vaccination movie screening , he decided to compare `` vaccine-induced '' autism to the holocaust . he said , `` they get the shot , that night they have a fever of a hundred and three , they go to sleep , and three months later their brain is gone , '' kennedy said . `` this is a holocaust , what this is doing to our country . '' a few days later , he apologized to people who were outraged on behalf of the memory of the holocaust . to many , it 's sacrilege to compare any lesser issue to the horrors perpetrated by the nazis . in a statement , kennedy said , `` i want to apologize to all whom i offended by my use of the word to describe the autism epidemic . i employed the term during an impromptu speech as i struggled to find an expression to convey the catastrophic tragedy of autism , which has now destroyed the lives of over 20 million children and shattered their families . '' robert kennedy jr. has apologized for the wrong things . first and foremost , vaccines do not cause autism . the two have nothing to do with each other . second , he seems to think people with autism are `` gone , '' their lives `` destroyed '' and their families `` shattered . '' autism is not a death sentence . people with autism are not missing or destroyed . they are everywhere , trying to live their lives in a society that too often demeans them as subhuman , missing or worthless . kennedy 's rhetoric is a problem , even beyond the fraudulent basis for his claims about vaccines . people who believe autism is an environmental disease try to cure kids with quack treatments like giving them bleach-based enemas . others , believing autism functions as a death sentence , even kill their children . i am worried about the effect of having such a powerful , high-profile member of our political class endorse this demeaning depiction of life with autism . i reached out to a number of autistic activists for comment . ari ne'eman , president of the autistic self-advocacy network , wrote , `` robert kennedy jr , who has engaged with autism only to spread lies , misinformation and dehumanizing rhetoric , has never meaningfully engaged in efforts to improve the lives of autistic americans . while his father , uncle and many others in the kennedy-shriver family championed the rights of people with disabilities , he has instead cast his lot with those who use pseudo-science to question our humanity . '' these are harsh words , but try to see the situation through ne'eman 's eyes . not only is kennedy perpetuating a discredited theory , but he 's also suggesting that it 's better to let your children get preventable and sometimes fatal diseases than risk becoming autistic . the usual response to people like ne'eman is that he is `` high functioning , '' but what of the burden to families who are struggling to care for less able individuals ? henry frost , an autistic teenager and writer , is devastated by this focus on burden . last year , he wrote a post to other autistic children : `` know you are not a burden or trouble for being . you are a person who has every right to be . a family that is saying love but saying you are so hard so wrong for not being as they wanted . the family is wrong . not you . '' meanwhile , amy sequenzia , an autistic activist and blogger , wrote , `` i am very disabled , have most of the usual not autism but co-occurring conditions , seizures almost every day , but am happy , proud and accomplished , with the human supports i have . that 's what is missing . acceptance . '' as children , sequenzia and frost might well have been just the kinds of people labeled as `` gone , '' by kennedy . clearly , both are very much present . the solution lies in understanding autism and related conditions as part of human diversity . michael s. monje jr. , an autistic writer and editor with autonomous press , wrote , `` the neurodiversity movement is a direct counter to this kind of attitude . it is a way for autistic people , as well as anyone else who experiences the world differently due to their neurology , to assert that these natural divergences in human development are just that -- natural . the fact that they are largely unsupported by our society as it is currently configured does not make them in any way less natural , less worthy , or less beautiful than other ways of being in the world . '' i wish kennedy realized how much his apology demeaned people with intellectual disabilities , even as he defended the sacred status of the holocaust . there is , though , one story from the holocaust that he might do well to consider . the first group the nazis systematically exterminated , in the infamous action t4 , were people with intellectual and other kinds of disabilities . thousands of children , adolescents and adults were sent to gas chambers , laying the groundwork for the later , larger scale acts of genocide . underlying action t4 was the belief that people with disabilities were devoid of value . we fight those beliefs by celebrating neurodiversity , not by fearmongering . kennedy owes a lot of people another apology .\\xe0\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' this bolsters the association 's previous positions to oppose the use of the term `` drug '' for chemicals used in lethal injection and to oppose laws that require or prohibit pharmacists from participation in lethal injection cases . the group acted this week because of increased public attention on lethal injection , said michelle spinnler , spokeswoman for the american pharmacists association . that spotlight includes a january supreme court decision to stay the execution for three death row inmates in oklahoma . this was prompted by clayton lockett 's execution by lethal injection nearly one year ago in which he writhed on a gurney for 43 minutes before he died from a heart attack . in georgia last month , the execution of female death row inmate kelly renee gissendaner was postponed as a precaution when the execution team checked the medications and discovered they looked cloudy . thirty-two sates allow capital punishment , and lethal injection is still the most common method . last month , utah gov. gary r. herbert signed a law reinstating firing squads as a method of execution in cases in which lethal injection medications are not available . of the eight inmates currently on death row in utah , three opted for the new choice of death by firing squad . pentobarbital is the preferred drug used for lethal injection . in texas , the department of criminal justice told cnn in march they are running out of their supply . in july 2011 , lundbeck inc. , the manufacturer of pentobarbital , decided to no longer provide the drug to prisons for use in capital punishment . the companies that manufacture the products traditionally used in executions almost unilaterally decided to stop selling to institutions that used the products for that purpose , so states then turned to compounded preparations , spinnler said . `` pharmacists should not be involved in preparation of these products or involved in executions in any other way . '' she says . the new declaration by the american pharmacists association aligns with positions held by other professional medical organizations such as the american medical association , the american nurses association and the american board of anesthesiology .)\\x1c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

think '' that between 800 and 850 people were on board the boat that capsized roughly 110 kilometers -lrb- 70 miles -rrb- north of libya . previous estimates had put the number of people aboard anywhere between 700 and 950 . italian authorities , who have been coordinating the rescue effort , say only 28 survivors were rescued and 24 bodies have been recovered . the king jacob , whose crew members are all from the philippines , saved 22 of the survivors , according to clark . the cause of the shipwreck is part of italian authorities ' investigation , said giovanni salvi , catania 's public prosecutor . investigators want to study the king jacob 's voyage data recorder and find the wreck of the sunken boat , he told a news conference monday . the likely toll makes the sinking the deadliest known disaster involving migrants crossing the mediterranean from north africa . many of the victims are feared to be still trapped inside the sunken boat . asami said the survivors told her and her colleagues that they were all on the highest part of the overcrowded boat , while many people were down in the lowest area . italian authorities said sunday that an unidentified bangladeshi survivor had told them that the smugglers had locked many people inside the lower levels of the vessel . two of the survivors were arrested on suspicion of human trafficking upon arriving in sicily on monday , according to italian police officer maria guia federico . they were the boat 's tunisian captain and a syrian crew member , said salvi , the catania prosecutor . italian police identified the two suspects through questioning survivors aboard the coast guard vessel that brought them to catania , salvi said , according to italian media . the sinking appears to be the worst among an intensifying spate of migrant boat disasters in the mediterranean to which european governments are struggling to respond . vast numbers of people fleeing violence and poverty have been setting out on the risky journey across the mediterranean to southern europe for years , but authorities have reported a sharp increase this month in the numbers in need of rescue . the number of deaths has also skyrocketed . the international organization for migration said monday that more than 1,100 people were estimated to have drowned in the waters between libya and italy just in the past week . it reported monday that three other migrant boats could be in distress in international waters . shipping companies recently warned that european governments are putting what they say is an unfair burden on their vessels to come to the aid of migrant boats in trouble . `` we believe it is unacceptable that the international community is increasingly relying on merchant ships and seafarers to undertake more and more large-scale rescues , with single ships having to rescue as many 500 people at a time , '' the european community shipowners associations said in a letter to eu leaders last month . `` commercial ships are not equipped to undertake such large-scale rescues , which also create serious risks to the safety , health and welfare of ships ' crews who should not be expected to deal which such situations , '' the letter said . commercial ships rescued more than 40,000 people in the mediterranean last year , according to the international organization for migration . that 's higher than the more than 35,000 people saved by the italian coast guard but lower than the 80,000 rescued by the italian navy , which was running a special program , mare nostrum , for most of the year . european union ministers met monday in luxembourg and proposed a 10-point plan to help address the crisis . `` we are not yet working on numbers , but what we have agreed on today is , for sure , the need to increase significantly the resources at sea , and the level of the operation , doing more search and rescue and doing it more together , '' said federica mogherini , the eu high representative for foreign affairs and security police . mogherini told cnn that the european union must fight human traffickers , strengthen europeans ' duty to save lives at sea and share responsibility when it comes to the resettlement and relocation of refugees . `` we need to fight the organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people , so that we can prevent desperate people from leaving in desperate conditions , '' mogherini said . `` my pain is that it was a reaction coming too late after so many people died . '' but some groups said european officials were offering too little too late . `` what we needed from eu foreign ministers today was life-saving action , but they dithered , '' said justin forsyth , the chief executive of save the children . `` with each day we delay we lose more innocent lives and europe slips further into an immoral abyss , '' forsyth said in a statement . `` right now , people desperately seeking a better life are drowning in politics .

'' the former senator and first lady first declared her support for same-sex marriage in early 2013 , saying that `` gay rights are human rights , and human rights are gay rights . '' russia 's controversial law caused an international outcry after it was passed by the russian parliament and signed by president vladimir putin in july 2013 . human rights watch described the anti-gay propaganda law as `` a profoundly discriminatory and dangerous bill that is bound to worsen homophobia in russia . '' rights campaigners called for a boycott of the 2014 winter olympics in sochi , and a number of bars around the world stopped serving russian vodka in protest . u.s. president barack obama -- clinton 's former boss -- said at the time that he found the legislation offensive . `` i have no patience for countries that try to treat gays or lesbians or transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or harmful to them , '' obama told jay leno in 2013 . putin defended the law , noting that unlike other countries , russia decriminalized homosexual relationships -lrb- in 1993 -rrb- . `` we do n't outlaw anything and do n't nab anyone , '' he said before the 2014 games . `` that 's why you can feel safe and free here , '' he added , `` but please leave our children in peace .

      "b\"\\xc1\\x1blondon -lrb- cnn -rrb- ever written yourself a note , stuffed it in your pocket and headed out into the world only to discover that , somewhere along your journey , the piece of paper has disappeared ? if you live in the uk , there 's a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23-year-old daisy bentley . for the past six years , the london-based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners are n't looking . her quest has uncovered a fascinating , if idiosyncratic , collection of shopping lists , reminders , requests , love notes and motivational musings , all poignant pieces of others ' lives . and now a gallery in london has put a selection on display for the public . `` i was n't intending to start a collection , '' she told cnn . `` i always naturally collected things -- as many artists do -- and it got to the point that i was picking up every one i saw . now i can barely walk down a street without picking up a scrap of paper . '' bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of norwich , england . it 's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother 's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity . the notes project , she says , is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people would n't notice as they walked down the street . `` i get very odd looks from strangers , '' she admits , `` but since i 've made friends and families aware of the project , they get very excited when i find one while out with them . '' and while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding , bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items , no matter how small or insignificant they may seem . `` humans want to collect and show to others , '' she says . `` they want to share and learn from the things they have found . '' she says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition . one of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades , from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the '70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i 's and multiple exclamation marks . more recently , the note collection has led to an exhibition at stour space gallery in london 's hackney wick , where bentley works as a shop and studio manager . it showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection . the decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space . `` i always wanted to showcase them , to see what people 's reactions were and if anyone would come forward , '' she said . so far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes . bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you . and while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint , as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting , bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people 's lives . `` technology is useful , but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best , '' she said . `` i still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same .

      "b\"\\xad5-lrb- cnn -rrb- on october 31 , 2014 , the italian government announced the end of `` mare nostrum '' -- a naval mission that rescued would-be migrants in peril as they tried to cross the mediterranean to seek security and a new life in europe . in the operation 's year-long existence , the italian navy and coastguard had rescued an estimated 100,000 people . but it proved expensive and politically contentious , and europe was not prepared to help italy shoulder the burden of the crisis . without european support , the italian government cut back the naval assets dedicated to rescuing migrants . mare nostrum , which had been launched after some 600 people died when two migrant ships sank in 2013 , was replaced by the more modest `` operation triton , '' under the auspices of the european union 's border agency , frontex . triton has about one-third of the funding of mare nostrum , with just six ships and patrol boats , two planes and one helicopter . it was designed as a policing rather than a humanitarian mission . at its inception , klaus rosler , operations director for frontex , said `` triton is not a replacement for mare nostrum . '' nor was frontex `` a coordinating body for search and rescue operations . '' six months later , the argument about how to handle unprecedented numbers of desperate people heading for europe continues unabated . contributors to triton include portugal , the netherlands , finland and iceland . britain -- for example -- is not . it argues that search and rescue operations in international waters are `` an unintended ` pull factor , ' encouraging more migrants to attempt the dangerous sea crossing and thereby leading to more tragic and unnecessary deaths . '' it 's perhaps no coincidence that immigration is a hot-button issue in britain , with the uk independence party attacking the conservative-led coalition government for being soft on allowing foreigners into the country . similarly , the opposition northern league in italy opposed mare nostrum , accusing it of enticing migrants . if the first few months of this year are any guide , demand has not diminished even if the prospect of being rescued has . people from syria , mali and eritrea are among the tens of thousands trying to escape repression , violence and abject poverty . despite the danger , the great majority head first for libya , where the collapse of authority allows smuggling operations to go unhindered . italy -- the european state whose territory is closest to libya -- has borne the brunt of the task of picking up , sheltering and providing food and medical help to the illegal migrants . in 2014 , 170,000 migrants arrived in italy by sea . italian ships have picked up about 11,000 migrants in the past week alone . the islands of sicily and of lampedusa -lrb- which is closer to tunisia than to mainland italy -rrb- see an almost daily influx of human misery . and at this time of year , there is a surge in the illegal trafficking as the weather and sea conditions improve . italian prime minister matteo renzi has said the mediterranean is a sea , not a cemetery . on sunday , in the wake of the latest disaster , he complained that italy had been coping with the crisis in `` near solitude , sometimes assisted by some other international presence . '' italy has also led calls for an international peacekeeping issue to help restore stability in libya , not least in an effort to tackle the flow of migrants , many of whom set out from around misrata and other ports in the west of the country . according to some human rights groups , the danger to migrants on the high seas has been accentuated by merchant ships turning a blind eye to boats in distress -- despite a maritime obligation to come to the aid of vessels in peril . after the latest sinking , the european commission called an urgent meeting of foreign and interior ministers , saying that `` the reality is stark and our actions must therefore be bold . these are human lives at stake , and the european union as a whole has a moral and humanitarian obligation to act . '' eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini , who is italian , said sunday : `` we need to save human lives all together , as all together we need to protect our borders and to fight the trafficking of human beings . '' the task could not be `` left only to the southern countries , '' she insisted . but bold action is rarely a hallmark of the eu . the recently installed head of the european commission , jean-claude junker , has set out his priorities -- but they are yet to be acted upon . junker said the current budget of frontex - some 90 million euros -lrb- $ 97 million -rrb- - was `` a good start but does not yet equal the task of protecting europe 's common borders . '' that money has to cover all frontex 's roles -- and it 's not only the italian coast that is being targeted by migrants . further east , thousands of migrants are trying to reach greece by land and sea . according to the un 's refugee agency , 219,000 refugees and migrants crossed the mediterranean last year . junker has also argued for greater assistance to the european asylum support office , which is based in malta , arguing for `` more thorough risk assessments to spot problem areas before they become overloaded . '' most controversially , junker is proposing europe adopt a common asylum system , saying that `` one and the same applicant for asylum can have a 70-75 % chance of being granted asylum in one country of the european union and less than 1 % , with the same reasons , in another country . '' but progress toward a europe-wide approach on migration is painfully slow . the european commission plans to publish a policy document next month , but member states are in no hurry to grapple with such a politically explosive and costly subject . in the meantime , the argument in european meetings is likely to focus on priorities , with some -lrb- the uk and germany -rrb- likely to argue that more resources must be devoted to cracking down on the lucrative people-smuggling racket . `` we must target the traffickers who are responsible for so many people dying at sea and prevent their innocent victims from being tricked or forced into making these perilous journeys , '' said british foreign secretary philip hammond sunday . others , including italy , greece , spain and france , are expected to seek more concerted action in handling and funding the influx . but the hundreds of migrants being herded onto barely seaworthy boats from libyan beaches will be oblivious to the debate . read more : migrant deaths at sea - what is europe going to do?read more : why migrants are risking their lives to reach italyread more : ' i enter europe or i die ' - desperate migrants rescuedread more : how do illegal immigrants get into europe ?}\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf9$-lrb- cnn -rrb- five years after the deepwater horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation 's history , we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions . the immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented , with declines in tourism and the seafood industry , as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region . since then , the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery . in fact , reports indicate that the gulf of mexico 's seafood industry , which supplies the united states with roughly 40 % of its seafood , is finally starting to rebound . however , profound challenges remain , in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered . to this day , it 's still unclear where all of the oil went , exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating . one of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the gulf crab . crabs play an important role in the region : roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the gulf in 2012 , earning tens of millions in revenue . yet in the aftermath of the spill , changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye . researchers documented substantial differences in appearance , and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints , forcing limbs to fall off . these traits have affected not only the crabs ' market value but also likely their ability to survive . while these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term , the health of these crabs could still be precarious . i have been working with colleagues at florida international university and university of louisiana at lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill . using the power of genomics and computational biology , we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the macondo prospect where the deepwater horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab . by studying gene expression , the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell , we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and , based on the types of changes we might see , clues as to how the crabs respond . although we are still in the early stages of our research , we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant . we are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce . it 's not just gulf crabs that are experiencing changes . research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill . this not only has consequences for the gulf area , where oil drilling continues , but also for communities along the atlantic coast , where the obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration . -lrb- bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , told cnn that wildlife species in the gulf have `` bounced back and `` there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' -rrb- . with the virtual certainty of more spills , we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently . the u.s. department of the interior and the environmental protection agency are making some progress . in coming months , they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the deepwater horizon spill . but government agencies can not just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis . instead , the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing , long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what `` normal '' looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill . only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources .\\x12\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfb\\x19boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- now the real boston marathon trial can begin . a federal jury 's decision to convict dzhokhar tsarnaev of 30 charges related to the 2013 boston marathon bombings was the most anticlimactic of anticlimaxes . the 21-year-old 's lawyers admitted from the beginning that their client had participated in the horrific terrorist attack , which both scarred and strengthened this city . the outcome of this first phase may have been preordained , but nearly two years after the bombing , the trial has held boston and the region in thrall -- more so than i might have imagined . the case regularly lands on the front pages of our two daily newspapers , the globe and the herald , and often leads the local television newscasts . the twitter feeds of reporters covering the trial are avidly followed . we have n't learned much new , although harrowing details about the deaths of the tsarnaev brothers ' four victims have come out . more than anything , many people find something cathartic in seeing the seemingly insolent , unrepentant tsarnaev being brought to justice . the only issue to be decided is whether tsarnaev should be executed . which is why the second phase of his trial is the one that really matters . was tsarnaev so thoroughly under the sway of his radicalized older brother , tamerlan , that he should be spared lethal injection ? or had this seemingly typical teenager transformed himself into a hardened jihadist who obsessed over al qaeda propaganda such as the article `` make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom '' ? what kind of justice should tsarnaev receive ? there is no death penalty in massachusetts , and in september 2013 , according to a globe poll , 57 % of respondents supported life in prison for tsarnaev ; just 33 % said he should be executed . by moving the case into federal court , u.s. attorney general eric holder made it likely that tsarnaev would receive the death penalty . keep in mind that no members of the jury were deemed eligible to serve unless they stated beforehand that they were willing to consider putting tsarnaev to death . but imagine a different scenario in which tsarnaev had been allowed to plead guilty in return for a life sentence . he would have been denied the public stage he has been granted ; although he has not testified -lrb- so far -rrb- , his terrorist actions have been replayed over and over again for people to see the world over . the 2015 boston marathon will take place in less than two weeks , on monday , april 20 . thousands of runners will clog the 26.2-mile route , and tens of thousands will cheer them on -- as they did last year , proving to the world that we will not be intimidated . and tsarnaev 's lawyers will still be fighting for their client 's life . it is a natural if disturbing reaction to events like this that it 's easier to remember the names of the perpetrators than of their victims . but dzhokhar tsarnaev is a loser and a nobody . he should be allowed to fade away into the obscurity of a maximum-security prison cell . the people who deserve to be remembered are those he and his brother killed on marathon day -- martin richard , krystle campbell and lingzi lu -- and sean collier , the mit police officer they executed in cold blood . it is they who should live on in our collective memories .\\xa5\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' `` i could n't see for a moment because my eyes were so watery and i was distraught , i was in a state of mind , i had no idea what was happening . i was almost about to black out . and i grabbed it and i started swinging , '' he told the court . mack told the court her mother had threatened to kill the couple 's unborn baby , according to local media . the prosecutor alleged that the two planned the murder , because mack 's mother disapproved of their relationship . after being detained by police , the couple initially claimed they 'd been taken captive at the resort by an armed gang , whose members killed heather 's mother , and from whom they managed to escape . the two were tried separately , though both trials were heard by the same court , with the same prosecutors . prosecutors had sought a prison sentence of 18 years for schaefer and 15 years for mack . under indonesian law , mack will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison for two years , after which she can nominate who should take custody . journalists fairuz husaini and ragil lestari and cnn 's kathy quiano contributed to this report .#\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfd)-lrb- cnn -rrb- mountaineers have returned to mount everest for this year 's climbing season , resuming the quest to summit the world 's highest peak after a deadly season last year . in 2014 , the nepal climbing season ended after a piece of glacial ice fell , unleashing an avalanche that killed 16 nepalis who had just finished their morning prayers . the april 18 accident was the single deadliest incident to ever occur on mount everest . the deaths launched fierce debates about the enormous risks faced by the sherpas and the dangers of climbing everest . in order to reduce risks , the route through khumbu icefall , the notoriously treacherous path where the 16 were killed , has been changed to one that takes longer but is expected to be safer . `` they 're going in the icefall and , as we found out on april 18 , it 's the most dangerous place , '' said conrad anker , a veteran climber who has been to everest three times . `` they 're exposed to the tumbling ice , hanging seracs above it . it 's very , very dangerous . it 's the most dangerous place i 've been in the mountains . '' at this point in the season , climbing teams have not yet entered khumbu icefall , which is essentially a frozen river rapid with jagged pieces breaking off and moving . nepal has issued 347 permits this year to climb mount everest , with 125 of them from the previously shortened season , according to the nepal ministry of tourism . it 's a slight increase from the 334 who were given permission last year . the local nepalese committee that determines the path up everest announced in february that a different route had been selected . the climbers will now take a central route through the khumbu icefall , avoiding the area where the deaths occurred . the committee comprised of sherpas voted to return to the central route for safety reasons . `` there will be little risk of avalanche than in the right or left , '' said yangji doma sherpa , the spokeswoman for the sagarmatha pollution control committee . the central route had been used in the 1990s , but was abandoned in favor of a quicker route , she said . the new path means climbers will have to cross more crevasses , and use more vertical and horizontal ladders . the committee issued a recommendation that the weight of workers ' gear be limited to avoid overloading the ladders . `` i think it will be an hour longer on the icefall , '' said alan arnette , who is blogging from everest base camp this season . `` i do n't think it will be game changer . '' but one company , alpenglow expeditions , said it would stop climbing from the nepal side , where the climbers have to go through the icefall , in favor of the northern route from china . `` we 've seen it get progressively more dangerous over the last few years , '' said adrian ballinger , the company 's founder and ceo . `` we believe the risk is too great for our workers . '' according to the china tibet mountaineering association , 320 people have been registered to climb the northern route to everest this year . that 's 136 more than last year . the chinese side of everest has typically been less popular than its nepal counterpart , because of concerns of government closures . some everest observers say the northern route has harsher weather and more rocky terrain , but it also does n't have an icefall . the increasing popularity of the northern route has caused concern amongst nepali companies that climbers will divert to the chinese side . `` i can already see the shift with mountaineers i speak to , '' said dawa steven sherpa , who is based in nepal . `` more people are going to go to tibet than nepal . nepal needs the tourism far more than china does . china has incredible wealth of resources and nepal does not . '' leading expeditions is how sherpas feed their families and send their children to school . nepal depends heavily on tourism dollars . many of the guides had to bury their friends after the accident last year , and while they may be ready to return to the summit , their families are not . many of them are `` leaving behind nervous , stressed-out wives and children , '' whose memories of what happened last year are fresh , said dawa sherpa , managing director of asian trekking . `` they do say they do n't want to put them through that again , '' he said . `` they 're not fearful for their own lives , it 's what they 're putting their family through . '' several mountaineers are also returning this year . one of them is jon reiter , who spoke to cnn last year after the tragedy . when the icy avalanche thundered down , reiter was shoved behind an ice block by his sherpa guide . reiter , who is making his way to base camp this year , could not be reached directly . but he explained why he 's heading back to everest this year on his blog . `` i ca n't quite find the words to tell you why , or what really pulls me back to the mountains , '' he wrote . `` when we were in the midst of last year 's events it was hard to see the big picture . it was hard to remember that people die in the mountains but that it 's more rare than not . `` it was hard for me to remember that i 'm not choosing between my life at home and dying in the mountains . i like to think it 's similar to surviving a plane crash or a major pile up on the freeway .

      "b\"\\xf8;boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- dzhokhar tsarnaev 's bombs tore through their bodies : singeing flesh , shattering bones , shredding muscles and severing limbs . but on tuesday , jurors also began to hear about the holes his bombs left in the hearts of the survivors and the families of the dead . now that he has been found guilty on every count , the jury must decide whether boston marathon bomber tsarnaev , 21 , should live or die for what he has done . this is the victim impact part of the case , and the testimony was heartbreaking . four young people are gone , and grief fills the spaces they once occupied . a father with a shock of white hair cried for the daughter he called `` princess . '' `` krystle was the light of my life . she was extremely smart , hardworking , beautiful , every father 's dream . i miss her a lot , '' said william a. campbell sr. , dabbing at his eyes as he described his daughter , a 29-year-old restaurant manager who was killed in the first blast at the 2013 boston marathon . she was the one who could round up the family and put on big celebrations , he said . `` nobody fills that boot now . '' others are expected to come and cry for lingzi lu , `` a jolly soul , '' assistant u.s. attorney nadine pellegrini said , quoting the slain chinese grad student 's father . more tears will be shed for martin richard , who was 8 and looked just like his dad . and for sean collier , who was remembered at his memorial service by these words : `` big heart , big smiles , big service . all love . '' `` dzhokhar tsarnaev murdered each one of them in a way that they had time to feel pain , they had time to be scared and frightened , but they had no time to say good-bye , '' pellegrini told the jury . `` and that is the very essence of terror . '' timeline of bombings , manhunt and aftermath . to understand the toll tsarnaev 's bombs took , jurors must know the stories of his victims , the prosecutor said . `` these young women , this young man and this little boy , all of them were loved and they loved in return , '' pellegrini said . `` before he murdered them in some of the cruelest ways imaginable , they were sons , they were daughters , they were grandchildren , they were brothers and they were sisters . '' jurors saw photograph after photograph of smiling , happy people with arms around siblings at weddings and birthday parties and family gatherings . there was the photo of campbell as a little girl in a red tap-dancing outfit . and then came the one that made her father smile through his tears . she was a little older and wearing a baseball uniform . `` she traded that in for a bat , '' campbell said . `` she was n't really a girly girl , but she loved to whitewater , camp , play baseball . she had a good arm on her . i was very proud of her . '' by contrast , jurors also were left with an indelible image of tsarnaev , taken when he was in a holding cell in the very courthouse where the trial is being held . it is dated july 10 , 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs at the boston marathon . he glares into the camera defiantly , his middle finger raised in a profane salute . `` this is dzhokhar tsarnaev , unconcerned , unrepentant and unchanged , '' pellegrini said . `` without remorse , he remains untouched by the grief and the loss that he caused . '' tsarnaev saw the people he killed as `` the enemy , '' she said . as a result , two women and a man never reached the age of 30 , and a little boy never made it to the third grade . `` he knew they were innocents . he even called them that , '' pellegrini added , referring to the message tsarnaev scrawled onto the sides of a boat where he hid from police after the bombings . `` but it did n't stop him from murdering them . '' the people who were maimed by tsarnaev 's bombs are also testifying during the sentencing phase of the trial as prosecutors try to show the impact on victims of the attacks . the stories they told on the witness stand were even more gripping and horrific than the stories told during the guilt phase of tsarnaev 's trial . when the first of the two bombs went off , gillian reny , a senior in high school , was standing near the woman she came to know was krystle campbell . `` there was a complete , utter chilling silence and then chaos . chaos like i 'd never seen and never hope to see again , '' she said . the force of the blast knocked her to the ground . when she looked around , she saw blood and muscle everywhere . her shin bone had snapped and was protruding . `` muscle was everywhere . it was the most horrifying image i could imagine . just seeing that on my own body , '' she said , and began to cry . `` i remember looking around and it just seemed like there were bodies everywhere , blood everywhere . '' were you bleeding ? she was asked . `` yes , enormously . looking down at the blood i was just shocked that much blood could come out of someone , '' she said . `` i was terrified that i was going to die . i did not know that i could be that injured and survive . '' she said she began to scream . her bone-chilling cries could be heard on a video played in court -- the most graphic of many graphic images the jury has been shown . doctors were able to save reny 's leg , but others were n't so lucky . celeste corcoran lost both legs , one below the knee and the other above the knee . an amputation above the knee is the most difficult injury to recover from , jurors have learned at this trial . corcoran was at the finish line , waiting for her sister to cross . `` and then our whole world just exploded , '' she said . `` i unfortunately remember every single detail . '' she remembers being knocked to the ground , hearing nothing and then screams , and seeing blood everywhere . `` it 's kind of hard to explain but i want to get it right for all of you to understand , '' she told the jury . she said it was `` a surreal , out-of-body experience . '' she remembers thinking , `` what was that ? '' and wishing she could turn back time by five minutes . her husband bent over her and told her it was a terrorist attack . by then , she began to feel pain worse than anything she had imagined . she wondered if she would die . `` it hurt too much . i just did n't care , '' she said . `` i remember thinking i was going to die , that no one could go through that much pain . i knew it was very bad and i was thinking , ` is this it ? am i going to die ? ' i remember thinking i wanted to die . the pain was too much . i wanted to die . '' and then , she said , `` the mom in me '' took over . she remembers telling herself : '' ` hell no , i do n't want to die . i have too much living to do . do n't let this be the end . this ca n't be the end . ' '' she remembers feeling relief once she arrived at the hospital , even as she signed the form authorizing doctors to take both her legs . `` can i get on with my life ? absolutely , '' she said . but she can never forget she 's a double amputee . `` there 's always a level of discomfort . right now i 'm not comfortable , '' she said from the witness stand . `` the bottoms of my limbs , there 's this constant numb burning sensation . the only way i can describe it is it 's like you have the worst athlete 's foot in my life . '' sometimes , she feels a stabbing sensation where her toes and calves used to be . `` you do n't realize until you 're a double amputee how many dips and hills and inclines there are , '' she said . `` inclines are very hard . '' daily life is literally an uphill battle . opinion : what tsarnaev deserves . cnn 's greg botelho contributed to this report .\\xdf\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xff(-lrb- cnn -rrb- pope francis has accepted the resignation of bishop robert finn , who remained on the job for years after becoming the highest-ranking u.s. catholic official convicted in connection with the church 's long-running sex abuse scandal , the vatican announced tuesday . finn , who led the diocese of kansas city-st . joseph , missouri , was found guilty in 2012 of failure to report suspected child abuse . the case was tried by a judge instead of by jury because prosecutors wanted to protect the young victims ' anonymity . finn was convicted of one count but not a misdemeanor charge he 'd also faced . he was put on two years ' probation but was not forced to spend time in jail or pay a fine , according to the jackson county prosecuting attorney 's office . two charges against his diocese were dropped . at the time of his conviction , finn said , according to cnn affiliate kctv : `` i truly regret and am sorry for the hurt these events have caused . '' jackson county prosecutor jean peters baker said the conviction and penalty , which included starting a $ 10,000 fund for sexual abuse counseling and mandatory training for church officials on how to report abuse , would have positive ramifications . `` we can be assured now that if an allegation of child abuse comes to the attention of the diocese of kansas city-st . joseph , there will be no hesitation to report it immediately to the proper authorities , '' baker said . the case against finn revolved around his diocese 's dealings with shawn ratigan , an independence , missouri , priest who pleaded guilty in august 2012 to five child pornography charges . church officials found disturbing images on ratigan 's computer but did n't notify police until nearly five months later , prosecutors said . in those interceding months , the priest kept on working . and finn kept his job as bishop , even after his 2012 conviction . the official website of the catholic diocese of kansas city-st . joseph still listed him as its bishop tuesday morning . cardinal sean o'malley , who took over the abuse-shaken boston archdiocese and has become one of the pope 's point men in the united states , has acknowledged the inconsistency that someone who would n't be allowed to teach sunday school was still running an american diocese . `` it 's a question that the holy see needs to address urgently , '' o'malley said in a `` 60 minutes '' interview in november . `` there 's a recognition of that ... from pope francis . '' candida moss -- a professor at notre dame , a catholic university in indiana -- said it `` does n't look very urgent '' that a decision came down only now , nearly three years after the conviction and five months after o'malley 's comments . several factors may have played a role in the delay , including views from lawyers or power players at the vatican , who may be reluctant to cast blame at high-level officials who do n't report allegations quickly enough to government authorities . but the timing of the announcement may make sense given that it comes weeks after francis came under fire for the installation of a new bishop in chile , juan barros , despite protesters ' claims he was complicit in sexual abuse cases there . `` it kind of shook francis ' reputation , '' said moss . `` having this resignation and putting right one of the more visible injustices on this , especially in the u.s. , i think this is a typical francis way to reinstall confidence . '' now that the case has been addressed , the kansas city-st . joseph diocese has a new leader : kansas archbishop joseph naumann . under the pope 's directive , naumann will be the kansas city diocese 's apostolic administrator , in addition to his regular responsibilities in kansas , until a permanent bishop is appointed , according to an announcement on the diocese 's website . `` i pray that the coming weeks and months will be a time of grace and healing for the diocese , '' naumann said in an open letter to parishioners . `` all of us , who are privileged to serve in leadership for the church , do so for only a season . it is not our church , but christ 's church . '' moss , the notre dame professor , predicted that the shuffling at the western missouri diocese will be `` very well received , '' though some may question why it took so long . `` it 's not just that it 's late , '' moss said , `` but it 's that francis could have been more explicit . '' to that point , the co-director of bishopaccountability.org asked for more elaboration than the vatican 's one-line announcement that francis accepted the resignation `` in accordance with ... canon law . '' anne doyle , from the watchdog group that documents the catholic church 's abuse crisis , called finn 's removal `` a good step but just the beginning . '' `` the pope must show that this decision represents a meaningful shift in papal practice -- that it signals a new era in bishop accountability , '' doyle said . '' ... what no pope has done to date is publicly confirm that he removed a culpable bishop because of his failure to make children 's safety his first priority . we urge pope francis to issue such a statement immediately . '' cnn 's anneclaire stapleton contributed to this report .\\xed\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' he called being inducted by wonder , `` a lion holding the door for a kitty cat . '' the moment of relative levity was welcome after moving tributes paid to the late lou reed by patti smith and reed 's widow , music artist laurie anderson , who shared the three rules for life that they came up with : `` one : do n't be afraid of anyone ; two : get a really good b ------ t detector and learn how to use it ; three : be really , really tender . '' smith had to push back tears on at least three occasions . she recalled a night when they wound up in the same hotel and reed invited her up . she found him in the tub dressed in black and she sat on the toilet and talked with him . green day was inducted by fall out boy , who referenced the length of some of the speeches . cracked fall out boy frontman patrick stump : `` i feel like i 'm in a line at the dmv . '' as one of the youngest acts , it 's not surprising they gave one of the two most exciting performances of the evening . rock hall induction ceremony : lou reed ` would be amused , ' says sister . the other belonged to tom morello , doyle bramhall ii and zac brown with harmonica player jason ricci performing `` born in chicago '' in tribute to the paul butterfield blues band . not only did ricci slay , but morello played a nasty scabrous solo that raised the hairs on your arm , it was so alive . miley cyrus inducted joan jett in her own inimitable way , recalling a time she walked in on jett smoking pot and being so turned on by her strength , wisdom and soul that the young pop star wanted to have sex with the legendary rocker . jett joined the blackhearts and foo fighters ' dave grohl for a mini-set that include such classics as `` bad reputation , '' the runaways ' `` cherry bomb '' and `` crimson and clover , '' the tommy james & the shondelles cover that jett took to no. 1 . it was that kind of a night , and it closed with a rousing version of the beatles ' `` i want to be your man , '' where just about everybody who could make it out on stage did , including a near-end guitar scrum/lead-off between gary clark jr. , morello , zac brown and yeah yeah yeahs ' nick zinner . \\xc2\\xa9 2015 billboard . all rights reserved .\\xd5\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xab--lrb- cnn -rrb- the arrest and death of freddie gray in baltimore has stoked protests and accusations of police brutality . but it 's unclear how gray , arrested on a weapons charge april 12 , suffered a severe spinal cord injury that led to his death seven days later . here are the big questions surrounding this explosive case : . gray 's arrest . what we know : gray was arrested on a weapons charge in a high-crime area of baltimore known for drugs . he `` gave up without the use of force , '' according to baltimore deputy police commissioner jerry rodriguez . an officer apparently took his taser out , and was prepared to use it on gray , but he never deployed it , rodriguez said , and none of the six officers involved in the arrest describe using force against the 25-year-old . gray was placed inside a police van and was able to talk , said rodriguez who described gray as upset . `` and when mr. gray was taken out of that van , he could not talk , and he could not breathe , '' according to rodriguez . what we do n't know : it 's unknown what caused the spinal cord injury that led to his death a week after the arrest , and it 's also unknown what , if anything , happened inside the van . the knife . what we know : court documents allege that baltimore police department officer garrett miller arrested gray after finding a switchblade in his pocket . the gray family attorney called the allegation a `` sideshow . '' gray was carrying a `` pocket knife of legal size , '' attorney william murphy told cnn . police never saw the knife and chased gray only after he ran from them , the attorney said . the court documents also say that gray `` fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence . '' `` the officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket . the defendant was arrested without force or incident , '' the documents say . `` the knife was recovered by this officer and found to be a spring assisted , one-hand-operated knife . '' maryland law makes it illegal to `` wear or carry a dangerous weapon of any kind concealed on or about the person , '' including switchblades . what we do n't know : it 's not clear that simply having a knife is a crime , said baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake . `` it is not necessarily probable cause to chase someone . so , we still have questions , '' she said . what can be seen on the released video . what we know : segments of cell phone video shot from two different positions appear to begin after gray has been arrested and show officers dragging gray , who is handcuffed , to a van . he can be heard screaming . `` he was dragged a bit , '' said rawlings-blake , `` but then you see him using his legs to get into the van , so he was able-bodied when he was in the van , and we know that when he was finally taken out of the van , he was unresponsive . '' officers placed more restraints on gray inside the van , police said , while surveillance video recorded him conscious and talking . that was at 8:54 a.m. . at 9:24 a.m. , police called an ambulance for gray . police say gray requested medical attention , including an inhaler , and an ambulance later took him to the university of maryland medical center 's shock trauma center . what we do n't know : it 's unknown why gray screamed , and the video does n't capture the entire incident , start to end . it 's unclear what happened between 8:54 a.m. and 9:24 a.m. police response . what we know : in the wake of gray 's death , six police officers have been suspended . their names were released tuesday , a standard procedure after an `` in-custody death , '' said baltimore police department spokesman capt. eric kowalczyk . it does n't mean the officers did anything wrong or that they were the only officers involved , he said . they are : lt. brian rice , 41 , who joined the department in 1997 ; officer caesar goodson , 45 , who joined in 1999 ; sgt. alicia white , 30 , who joined in 2010 ; officer william porter , 25 , who joined in 2012 ; officer garrett miller , 26 , who joined in 2012 ; and officer edward nero , 29 , who joined in 2012 . police commissioner anthony batts said that authorities plan to conclude their investigation by may 1 . their findings will go to the state 's attorney 's office , where prosecutors will decide whether charges should be filed . what we do n't know : the officers say they did n't use force against gray , but that 's not certain . gray 's past run-ins with authorities . what we know : according to court documents cnn obtained , there were more than 20 criminal court cases in maryland against gray , and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death . the cases involve mostly drug-related charges , but there are charges from march for second-degree assault and destruction of property . gray was due in court on a possession charge on april 24 . he had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases , said maryland department of corrections spokesman gerard shields . in february 2009 , he was sentenced to four years in prison for two counts of drug possession with intent to deliver . shields said he could not determine from records what kind of drug was involved . gray was paroled on june 30 , 2011 . on april 4 , 2012 , gray was arrested for violating parole but he did n't go back to prison , shields said , reasoning that whatever gray allegedly did , it `` was something minor . '' gray went back to prison again in may 2013 for drug possession and served a month . he was released in june . what we do n't know : it 's not known whether gray 's criminal past had anything to do with his arrest , or his death . cnn 's anneclaire stapleton , stephanie gallman and eliott c. mclaughlin , dana ford and ben brumfield contributed to this report .\\xc6\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xce\\x17-lrb- cnn -rrb- the question : how can i know if my food is safe to eat after a specific product recall ? the answer : many of us shed a few tears over the recent sabra hummus recall -lrb- even though we are perfectly capable of making our own at home -rrb- , but that sadness quickly transformed into anxiety when we looked inside our refrigerators and saw the potentially tainted culprit sitting there on the shelf . to assuage any fears , we asked john swartzberg , m.d. , a clinical professor at the university of california at berkeley , to walk us through the process of determining if our favorite dip was still safe to eat . related : amy 's kitchen recalls more than 70,000 cases of food due to fear of listeria contamination . the first step , according to swartzberg , is to go to the food and drug administration 's website and find the official report for the recalled product you 're worried about . each report will list recalled items with their product codes , which are typically categorized by the universal product code -lrb- the number adjacent to the barcode -rrb- or the stock keeping unit -lrb- a specific number that would only be valid at the store where the product is being sold -rrb- . they will also include the recalled products ' use-by dates , and the geographical areas affected . `` the recall is not based on the use-by dates , though , '' said swartzberg . `` if the product is within the use-by date , it should still be recalled . this makes sense , because the product was contaminated prior to purchase and no matter how ` fresh ' the product is , it still may be contaminated . '' after cross-checking these details , you should have a strong sense of whether your food product is safe to eat or needs to be trashed right away . but as far as avoiding potential problems before learning such details about a food recall , the consumer is at an automatic disadvantage . related : 14 habits of people with a healthy relationship to food . `` there 's nothing the consumer can do prior to learning about the recall , '' said dr. swartzberg . `` discarding or returning the product to the store is all that can be done . '' in the case of this specific hummus recall , while there was no evidence that it caused any consumer illness , the product 's routine sample last month revealed the presence of listeria monocytogenes . consuming such bacteria can lead to listeriosis , a serious infection , and dr. swartzberg recommends that anyone who has consumed a listeria-laden food should let their physician know as soon as possible . `` listeria survives well at cool temperatures , '' he said . `` most bacteria and fungi do not -- that 's why we refrigerate . healthy people are at low risk for disease , but it can happen . those at greatest risk for disease are the elderly , immunocompromised and pregnant .

      "b\"\\xa1(-lrb- cnn -rrb- i usually think of april as tax month , but it seems to be morphing into national get tested month . dallas mavericks owner mark cuban advised twitterers to have their blood tested for everything available -- and to do so every three months . following her mother 's cancer diagnosis , singer taylor swift urged her fans to remind their parents to get screening tests . and arizona gov. doug ducey signed legislation to allow arizonans to get any lab test without a doctor 's order . freedom of information -- always sounds like a good thing . but there are many lab tests to order on yourself : medicare 's clinical diagnostic laboratory fee schedule lists over a thousand . they are not all blood tests , but a lot of them are . and since blood tests require blood , you would surely develop at least one medical problem if you actually followed mr. cuban 's advice to get them all : anemia . a frothy private sector is gearing up to serve the `` test me '' market . in those states that allow it -- and over half do -- laboratories are offering walk-in and online services to individuals who want to check their own lab values . -lrb- and if you want to get in on the ground floor of this business , check out the franchise opportunities at any labtest now , fastest labs , and all labtests fast . -rrb- . some might argue that this freedom to test is the path to a healthier society . but the primary effect wo n't be more health , but rather more medical care . fundamentally well people will appear in doctors ' offices with `` abnormal '' results . abnormalities are common in normal people , as we learned when whole-body ct scanning was in vogue a decade ago -lrb- thankfully , only briefly -rrb- . so doctors will increasingly face one of two options : take the time to reassure these new patients that their results are n't really that abnormal or chase down abnormal results with more testing . further testing will often make clear that the initial results were false alarms . or it will confirm the presence of abnormality -- most of which will be minor abnormalities . often it wo n't be clear what to do , but doctors will be pressed to do something . that 's when the real problems begin . will anybody be helped ? maybe . will anybody be hurt ? definitely . the disturbing truth is that it is hard for us to make well people feel better . but it 's not that hard for us to make them feel worse . decades of research have shown that there are real side-effects to testing the well : more anxiety -lrb- that ca n't be good for your health -rrb- , more procedures -lrb- which often involve needles , pain and can even lead to complications like collapsed lungs -rrb- and more treatment for `` disease '' not destined to cause problems -lrb- as in over a million additional american men treated for prostate cancer , ditto women for breast cancer -rrb- . to see how far wrong testing can go , check out south korea : where ultrasound screening has increased the amount of thyroid cancer -- and thyroid cancer surgery -- by 15-fold . i can tell you one thing for sure , the freedom to test wo n't save money . sure , a competitive market will drive down prices for individual tests . but advertising will drive up the volume of testing . and then there are all the office visits and subsequent testing for the abnormal results . this will cost people real money -- either in terms of higher insurance premiums or higher out-of-pocket costs . maybe this kind of freedom of information is n't such a good thing . of course , there have been genuine advances in diagnostic testing . diagnostic tests can be extremely useful in sorting out acute medical problems . but if you feel well , do n't think that testing will make you feel better . the biotech sector is excited about testing well people -- it 's a huge market -- and is developing lots of new product . now you can sequence your dna , soon you will be able to monitor your immune system 's signature . now you can monitor your vital signs on your smartwatch , soon you will be able to test your breath for lung cancer on a phone app . they are even implanting thermodynamic sensors in a bra to test for breast cancer . a breast cancer monitoring bra -- i ca n't make this stuff up . should we outlaw an individual 's freedom to test ? no . we do n't need another victimless crime . but it is certainly an area that demands regulation . the food and drug administration has a longstanding mandate to protect us from snake oil treatments . now it needs to start worrying about snake oil testing . it 's also an area that demands education . the public needs to know that while medical data can be very useful , that does n't mean they are routinely useful . abnormalities in sick patients mean something different than the same abnormalities in well people . it is easier to collect data than it is to know what the data mean -- much less what to do about the results . freedom is a good thing . but feel free not to exercise your freedoms . just as carrying a gun does n't necessarily make you any safer , testing yourself does n't necessarily make you any healthier .\\xb2\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd1'-lrb- cnn -rrb- saudi arabia has executed a second indonesian maid despite protests from jakarta , which is itself facing fierce criticism for its failure to heed calls for clemency for a number of foreigners on death row . the indonesian government summoned the saudi ambassador to the foreign ministry on thursday after learning that 37-year-old karni bt . medi tarsim had been beheaded , without official warning . karni was sentenced to death in march 2013 for killing her employer 's four-year-old child . she was the second indonesian domestic worker executed by the saudis this week , following the death of siti zaenab bt . duhri rupa on tuesday -- the execution again carried out with indonesian officials receiving no prior warning . `` that is our main issue . it 's not that suddenly there was an execution . we did n't know when it would take place . still , we took over a hundred steps to try to free -lrb- siti -rrb- from execution , '' said arrmanatha nasir , spokesman for indonesia 's ministry of foreign affairs . siti , 47 , was convicted of killing her employer 's wife in 1999 , but the death penalty was delayed until the youngest of the victim 's sons reached puberty and was old enough to consider requesting her pardon . he did n't . rights groups say they suspect siti was mentally ill and cast aspersions on claims she had confessed to the crime . amnesty international also said reports suggested she had been abused while working in the victim 's home . `` imposing the death penalty and executing someone with a suspected mental illness smacks of a basic lack of humanity , '' said philip luther , middle east and north africa programme director at amnesty international . in a statement , the indonesian government said the protection of its citizens abroad was a `` priority '' and listed the attempts it had made to help siti , including providing legal aid , writing letters to the saudi king and `` continuous efforts ... to ask for forgiveness from the family . '' indonesia said in many cases its efforts had worked . from july 2011 to the end of march this year , it said it had `` successfully freed '' 238 of its citizens from the death penalty . one of those was satinah binti jumadi ahmad who was sentenced to death in 2011 after reportedly admitting to killing her 70-year-old employer and stealing $ 10,000 . satinah claimed she acted in self-dense . days before her scheduled execution , the indonesian government stepped in with so-called `` blood money '' of 7 million saudi riyals -- at the time worth about $ 1.8 million . satinah was spared . indonesia 's efforts to save its own citizens does not sit well with advocates who are seeking the same mercy for foreigners languishing on indonesia 's death row . two of the most high profile cases are andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , australians convicted of attempting to smuggle heroin from bali to australia in 2005 . friday marks the 10-year anniversary of their arrest with seven other people -- members of the so-called `` bali nine '' -- who are currently serving lengthy sentences in indonesian prisons . as the alleged ringleaders , chan and sukumaran were sentenced to death , and denied clemency from president jokowi widodo , a decision being challenged through the country 's constitutional court . `` if indonesia wants to effectively protect indonesians from the death penalty abroad , indonesia should also abolish the death penalty here , '' said todung mulya lubis , one of the men 's lawyers . chan , 31 , and sukumaran -- who also turns 34 on friday -- are currently incarcerated on nusakambangan island in preparation for their execution but no date has been set . human rights watch called on widodo to suspend all planned executions in indonesia -- as the previous government did between 2008 and 2013 . no executions were carried out in 2014 , but earlier this year , six people -- including five foreigners -- faced the firing squad . `` the executions of two indonesian citizens in saudi arabia in a single week should be a turning point on the subject of death penalty in indonesia , '' said andreas harsono , the indonesian researcher for human rights watch . `` please stop the lecture of sovereignty . it is so old fashioned . '' before news of the second execution emerged on thursday , the indonesian ministry of foreign affairs held a press briefing to denounce the saudi action . when asked whether jakarta 's complaints smacked of hypocrisy , given the country 's refusal to spare foreigners on death row , spokesman arrmanatha nasir said : `` if you read our constitution , it is the job , the role of the government to protect its citizens , right ? so it 's not a double standard . '' `` on the issue of death penalty , we can have a long debate whether it is against human rights or it is morally wrong or right . that 's a whole other discussion , that 's a whole other argument , but what we 're saying now here is we are implementing our laws and we are adhering to our constitution that we have to protect our citizens abroad .

      "b\"\\xf8\\r-lrb- cnn -rrb- australian prime minister tony abbott has been caught on camera guzzling a glass of beer in seven seconds amid raucous cheers from onlookers . his feat of swift consumption in a crowded bar impressed some people but annoyed others . and observers were quick to point out that abbott had previously criticized binge drinking in australia . abbott was in a sydney pub on saturday evening when a group of australian rules football players invited him to have a drink with them . the prime minister accepted and even gave a short , impromptu speech , one of the football coaches , simon carrodus , told the australian woman 's weekly . `` then he proceeds to reach down and grab a schooner and he drank from head-to-toe the entire schooner , dribbling little bits on his shirt ... tipped it upside down on his head . and he was proud as punch , '' carrodus said . a schooner holds about three-quarters of a pint . video of abbott making short work of the beer as the crowd around him chants `` skol ! skol ! '' drew plenty of attention on social media . some commentators focused on abbott 's drinking technique . but others suggested he was setting a bad example . abbott had attacked binge drinking as recently as last year . `` like most australians , i enjoy a drink on social occasions , '' he said in january 2014 . `` however , as a father and as a citizen , i 'm appalled by the violent binge drinking culture that now seems so prevalent , especially at `` hot spots '' in our big cities . '' casting those concerns aside , some social media users belittled abbott 's beer swilling . they said his effort was a pale imitation of the legendary drinking exploits of former prime minister bob hawke , who is credited with drinking two and a half pints in 11 seconds .\\xc9\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x93\\x1clondon -lrb- cnn -rrb- a polish prince has challenged populist british politician nigel farage to a duel in london 's hyde park over his immigration policy . farage , the leader of the uk independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , complains that britain 's membership of the european union means it is powerless to stop a flow of foreign immigrants , many from impoverished eastern europe , into his `` small island '' nation . in a video posted on youtube , prince jan zylinski said he was fed up with discrimination against poles living in britain . `` the most idiotic example i 've heard of has been mr. nigel farage blaming migrants for traffic jams on the m40 , '' zylinksi said . holding a sword that had belonged to his father -- a world war ii war hero -- the prince laid down a verbal gauntlet . `` enough is enough , mr. farage . so what i 'd like to do , mr. farage , is to challenge you to a duel , '' he said . `` i would like us to meet in hyde park one morning with our swords and resolve this matter in the way that an 18th century polish aristocrat and an english gentleman would traditionally do . `` are you up for it mr. farage ? '' farage -- who is on the campaign trail ahead of britain 's general elections on may 7 -- said he did not intend to cross swords with the prince . `` it is an impressive sword . i do n't have one but i 'm sure we could find one if we had to . but i 'm not intending to accept the offer , '' a spokesman quoted him as saying . `` i would have thought that a polish prince with a long polish lineage would rather agree with me that it 's a complete tragedy for poland that it 's lost so many of its brightest and best young people . '' ukip wants britain to leave the european union . it says it would not seek to remain a party to the region 's free trade or economic treaties `` while those treaties maintain a principle of free movement of labor , which prevents the uk managing its own borders . '' it has also pledged to cut the country 's # 9 billion -lrb- $ 12.4 b -rrb- annual foreign aid budget . another ukip politician appeared to back his party leader 's chances in a duel , tweeting an image of a medieval knight sliced in two , with the comment : `` this is what nigel would do to him . '' but there was no word on whether farage would even accept the prince 's less life-threatening back-up challenge . `` alternatively , if you do n't agree or if your sword is a little bit rusty , mr. farage , we can meet for a different kind of duel -- a duel with words in a tv studio in the run-up to the elections , '' zylinski suggested . `` i 'm up for it , it would be really nice , hopefully you will agree . '' zylinski posted a separate video on youtube entitled `` 7 reasons why the british should love the poles , '' in which he pointed to a times newspaper headline from march reading : `` we need more migrants ... they are the best workers in britain . '' the headline , he said , applied `` principally '' to the poles . `` what i can not accept is the amount of hostility and in some cases hatred towards the poles . enough is enough , i say , this has got to stop . '' zylinski pointed to polish contributions to britain including those made by polish raf pilots during the battle of britain , what he said was a `` wonderful work ethic '' and easy integration into the community . `` we are often more loyal to britain than many british people i know , '' he said . `` we are very grateful to be here . we would like you to be grateful too . please stop knocking the poles . we love this country we would like british to love us too .

      "b\"\\xc7/-lrb- cnn -rrb- italians have a saying : `` too much of something cripples it . '' we 're overcrowded with so many frescoed churches , medieval castles and roman ruins that we simply do n't know what to do with them , let alone care for a proper upkeep . we 've turned blind to their value and beauty . there are nearly 5,000 `` gems '' scattered across the country , ranging from museums to archaeological areas and monuments . italy boasts the highest number of unesco world heritage sites in the world -- 50 , several of which risk crumbling to the ground due to neglect and lack of public resources . and there are another 42,000 that are at the mercy of mudslides , floods and natural calamities . the unesco-listed basilica of assisi , where st. frances ' tomb lies , is just the last of a series of national shames . its frescoed walls by renaissance masters including giotto risk falling down and are badly in need of a restyle . in a desperate move the monks have launched a crowdfunding project to raise 500,000 euros . we 're talking of one of the biggest pilgrimage sites in the world -- not to mention its artistic value . i remember once an american colleague asking me : `` but what does italy do with its immense cultural heritage '' ? good question . if other nations had half as much of what we boast , they 'd make a much better job with it . paradoxically , if we had just the coliseum or venice it would be easier . but we do n't and trouble is italy does n't know how to exploit this treasure . take the british museum 's successful exhibition on pompeii in 2013 : we have the real site in our backyard but the british made the best of it worldwide while the real pompeii was -- and still is -- making global headlines just because of its frequent collapses . or , worse , italy could n't care less to promote its assets . as a travel writer i have the misfortune of dealing with tourist offices almost on a daily basis and it 's a battle : many are reluctant to give information and have no good photos of places . i find myself almost begging them , when it should be the other way round . the true but sad thing is that restyling in italy is mainly thanks to private funds and sponsors . crowdfunding has already saved bologna 's san luca portico . the coliseum is getting a makeover thanks to shoe brand todd 's , while a few visionary businessmen are rescuing crumbling villages by turning them into luxury resorts . yet it 's not just a matter of scarce public resources or austerity-driven measures . it 's also about not having a sense of artistic and cultural attachment , the care to cherish a country 's valuable monuments . and that 's because italians have always lacked a sense of national belonging : italy , despite its millenary history , is one of the world 's most modern states , unified in 1861 . patriot massimo d'azeglio once said : `` now that we 've made italy , we need to make italians . '' tough job indeed , and we 're still a long way to go . there 's also wide-spread approach that tends to limit restyling in general . heritage authorities are in love with the romantic ideal `` of decadent ruins '' : better leave the monument or site as it is , even allow it to rot , rather than recover it and `` destroy its original beauty . '' each time new subway works bring to light an unknown roman theatre or necropoli , it all freezes - the public works and the artistic upkeep . preservation is equal to negligence and oblivion . but that 's a blind approach . there 's so much italy could do with what it has , that it could live off tourism . symbola foundation estimates that culture and art , if well exploited , could generate a turnover of 214 billion euros a year , amounting to 15.3 % of gdp . another thorny issue is having a cheap culture . entrance tickets to the coliseum , italy 's top site that each year lures more than 6 million tourists , cost a maximum of 12 euros . matera 's rock crypts are 5 euros . not to mention churches featuring michelangelo 's works , which are free to enter . the first time i visited westminster abbey in london , and st. patrick 's church in dublin , i was shocked to find out i had to pay to get in . and it was quite expensive , too . one could argue that italy does well to open for free the lord 's doors , but probably in some `` critical '' cases a minimum cost to enter would n't hurt . the country 's mindset needs to change , too . monuments and works of art are not dead , but living things that deserve to be sexed-up once in a while . if we do n't have enough space to showcase all of them or the money for their maintenance , why not give them over to other countries to run ? or sell them to rich businessmen ? similar options make state authorities ' hair stand on end : they stress art belongs to the italian people and should remain in public hands -- even if it 's inaccessible and unenjoyable . yet is it better to have a public ruin or a private , thriving multimedia museum ? the uffizi galleries ' secret cellars are stacked with 2,500 forgotten masterpieces , which could be leased out to privates . curators fear the artworks could get damaged if moved . but cobwebs and dust can do no harm , right ? our sunny piazzas , bridges and frescoed castles should be regularly rented out for lavish ceremonies and weddings of billionaires couples or for major company events that would bring millions of euros to cities ' coffers . and who cares if for one single evening residents are unable to park their car in front of their palazzo ? there are also 6,000 abandoned medieval `` ghost towns '' that could be recovered or sold to revamp local economy . the state should also speed up the process of putting up for auction hundreds of artistic sites and historical buildings to privates and international investors who get to run them for 50 years . since the project launch in 2012 so far just two restyles have worked out , one being a renaissance villa in florence turned into a deluxe spa resort . fine , rome was n't built in a day . but it could crumble in an hour .K\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' while the first apartments in carlsberg city went up for sale in march , the area has been alive for years . investors invited temporary renters into old buildings during the construction phase which began shortly after the 2008 financial crisis hit . the area has since been home to skateboarders , bikers , modern dancers , cafes , the national football team for homeless people and a climbing forest . and the head of carlsberg city says this ploy has more than paid off . `` the temporary activities have been keeping carlsberg city on the landmap even in planning , '' said jens nyhus , ceo of carlsbergbyen -lrb- carlsberg city -rrb- . `` when the financial crisis started -lrb- they -rrb- were a way to keep the building occupied and from running down . it kept the city alive and opened up . '' but just because new tenants have moved in does n't mean it 's brewing history will be gone completely . carlsberg will remain very much inside carlsberg city , making specialty beer and building a tourist center that is expected to attract half-a-million visitors per-year when it opens in 2017 . `` we call it carlsberg brand and experience center , '' said thomas kjelfred , communications consultant at visit carlsberg . '' -lrb- but -rrb- it 's not a brand house , it 's a brew house . until six years ago , we brewed 200 million liters a beer -lrb- here -rrb- '' `` to a dane , carlsberg is more than a beer . it is art , it is science , it is culture .

      "b\"\\xbf\\x1d-lrb- cnn -rrb- south america 's atacama desert , one of the driest places on earth , resembles some of the faraway planets monitored by giant telescopes there . the lack of humidity provides optimal conditions to watch the sky and study the origins of the universe . `` it is pure visual silence , '' said photographer andres figueroa . `` it is amazing . there is absolutely no humidity , and -lrb- these conditions -rrb- create some striking contrasts . '' there , in that clear , inhospitably arid environment , figueroa turned his camera lens toward another discussion on cosmology , one rooted in the ancient folklore of the andean people . taking along his mobile lighting studio , figueroa photographed a series of religious festivals that take place every july in the atacama . in his `` dancers of the deserts '' series , figueroa chronicles these festivals , which attract about 200,000 people to some otherwise quiet mining towns in chile . `` i have always wanted to see the desert . even though i am not very religious , i 've always been curious about their traditions , '' said figueroa , who is from the chilean capital of santiago . figueroa worked hard on cataloging and differentiating the ceremonies and their complex rituals -- at times playing the role of an artist , others as an anthropologist -- but he always remained faithful to his love for classic portraiture . `` from an anthropological standpoint , i was interested in documenting all the signs and symbols that appear in each costume and character , all the indigenous and catholic syncretism , '' he said . `` my lighting studio allowed me to pick up on these details . `` from a portraiture standpoint , i used a formal approach to explain this living culture that is constantly growing and reinventing itself . i asked each character to stop to be photographed , taking them away momentarily from the festival in a more intimate scenario . '' photographing adobe walls , desert landscapes and the ubiquitous camping sites where pilgrims come to gather , figueroa said each character is perched in his or her own context . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . bears and devils pose in the desert in striking contrast . these photos highlight the uniqueness of andean culture , which draws influences from europe , the inca and more recently , chinese traditions . there are endless nuances , not always perceived by the naked eye . `` it is a very special festival . when you see the bears , you see them participating in the different roles , blending in with the -lrb- the devils -rrb- , '' figueroa said . `` and sometimes , you see them as a central figure in a festival of their own . it is amazing , a tradition brought by the chinese near peru . '' figueroa , who befriended many of the musicians and dancers , said it was important to take part in the festival in order to understand its meaning to the community . `` i had to understand the hierarchy and protocols of each group , '' he said . `` as a photographer , it is important to create the conditions for things to happen . you can have it all planned and set up in order for things to naturally take place . '' figueroa said the desert festivals have a deeper role in a region that struggles with social problems such as drug trafficking and poverty . it is the glue that binds families , and young people heavily invest their time and money to make their costumes and parade with pride . the festivals `` are a form of social protection , '' figueroa said . `` i felt the presence of love ... their love and effort in communicating with their divinity and holding together as communities .

      "b\"\\xfe1-lrb- cnn -rrb- i 've been in disaster management long enough to know that there is really no one right way to mark the anniversary of a tragic event . as the boston marathon runners begin and , hopefully , finish their exhausting run monday , the lingering memories of the 2013 marathon blasts will be seen and felt in all sorts of ways . more public safety officials throughout the route , a finish line area that prohibits large bags , national guard members in full uniform giving some sense of security -- those are the most obvious , visible changes . and there are less obvious ones too . with the luxury of some time and healing , the city has moved on . and that is a blessing . in the midst of that weeklong tragedy -- the bombings , the manhunt , the lockdown and eventual capture or killing of the tsarnaev brothers -- we thought we knew what was going on . but we were too much in the midst of our own situational awareness , the fog of war . sometimes it takes years to determine what in fact occurred and to write a narrative that reflects a multitude of voices and opinions . that narrative is just forming , and it 's worth going back to highlight some of the more strategic lessons that came out of that week . as a former homeland security adviser for massachusetts , i was intimately involved with the marathon planning ; as a commentator for cnn , i saw the story evolve during that week . some of these lessons learned are informed by the luxury of time and hindsight , others by various after-action reports and assessments , and others by the trial of dzhokhar tsarnaev , in which a jury found him guilty of multiple counts . on tuesday , the trial 's sentencing phase will begin , determining whether he will receive the death penalty . in national security circles , there is often a debate about whether the u.s. judicial system is well equipped for terrorism trials . terrorism , the argument goes , is different from traditional crimes , and our system of evidence and cross-examination and the promise of counsel are not appropriate to transnational threats . even if this argument were valid in some context -- where terrorists were picked up on battlegrounds abroad and evidence against them might be difficult to obtain -- the boston marathon trial made clear that the system does work . what was amazing about a trial filled with so much emotion is that it was relatively unemotional . prosecutors presented evidence . defense attorneys challenged the witnesses . the defendant chose not to testify . a verdict was rendered . its simplicity not only vindicated the capacity of our constitutional system to handle these cases , but also took the mythology -lrb- maybe even the romanticism -rrb- of terrorism out of the case . it rendered tsarnaev a common criminal . and that was a statement worth making . recent reports about the shootout in watertown that friday night in 2013 show a disorganized and often unnecessarily dangerous response during the manhunt . it is truly remarkable there were not more significant friendly fire casualties beyond the wounding of massachusetts transit police officer richard donohue as more and more police officials came to the town and failed to fall into place in what should ideally be a very delineated command structure . maybe it was adrenaline , maybe it was just the nature of the weapons . what is clear -- in watertown and in so many other police departments -- is that our police officers are not adequately trained for the kind of weapons that they have now . that is a dangerous gap , and too many police departments are failing to address it . we have a notion of `` boston strong '' coming from the attacks and the city 's response . i never loved the term , mostly because it makes it seem that our ability to bounce back was because we have puritan stock and a kick-ass attitude . that is only partially true . we risk believing that responses to tragedy are simply a matter of personal reflection and a `` keep calm '' persona . i have come to believe that what united us as a city was based on the competency of the response . the quick decisions to move runners off boylston street , the ability of police officers to seal the large crime zone and to utilize the military to do so , the pivot of public health officials from tending to blisters and dehydration to forming makeshift triage centers . it is worth remembering that not a single person of the hundreds who were transported to hospitals died ; the three fatalities occurred at the bombing site only . one part of the response that does n't get enough mention is the focus on family unification immediately after the attacks . runners had no access to phones , and often had no identification . family members of runners often did n't know where their loved ones were on the marathon route . first responders , in particular the boston police and the red cross , focused on getting families back together again by moving runners and spectators to commonwealth avenue , a few blocks from the finish line . once family members know that they are with loved ones , the trauma subsides . they often leave the scene , freeing up space and capacity so that public safety can focus on more immediate needs . crisis planning must continue to focus on the one aspect that will matter most to those in a disaster : is my family ok ? obviously , there is so much more to learn . could the bombing have been avoided ? what would have happened if the fbi had shared information it had on the tsarnaev family with local police ? what if family and friends had alerted authorities to the growing radicalization of the brothers ? it 's `` woulda , coulda , shoulda '' but still essential . one of the reasons it is crucial to go back and draw these lessons is n't simply for blame , but to get better for the next time . analysis and criticism are necessary to make us stronger and more resilient . but do not believe that we are done learning . looking back can be risky ; it 's often called the `` blinding clarity of hindsight '' because everything looks so obvious in the rearview mirror . but i have no doubt that at future anniversaries , what we know today will be altered and reformed and a new narrative might be written . and maybe the best way to remember today is to commit to a constant willingness to learn from this tragedy in all the years ahead .\\xba\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbf/washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- early clinton campaign calculations , the favored way for one of her opponents to channel his concerns , a gop ticket for the generations , and republican calendar concerns filled our sunday trip around the `` inside politics '' table . 1 . watch the volume as o'malley uses youtube to test clinton pokes . slowly but clearly , former maryland gov. martin o'malley is intensifying his criticism of overwhelming democratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton . how aggressive will he get ? stay tuned -- literally . cnn 's jeff zeleny says o'malley enjoys using youtube videos as a quick way to spread his opinion -- and question moves by clinton , like her reversal on the question of whether she supports allowing undocumented workers to obtain driver 's licenses . `` every time hillary clinton sort of adjusts her positioning from '08 to '16 -- her statement on the drivers ' licenses that we discussed and other things -- martin o'malley has been releasing a youtube video showing a speech where he has done something different , so watch for that to continue , '' said zeleny . `` those youtube videos on his channel will be a key part of the race -- the liberals love them . '' 2 . the `` obama factor '' : clinton finds a lot to love , and some distance . hillary clinton is a big fan of president obama 's health care law , but not so much of a booster when it comes to his presidential leadership style . so reports ap 's lisa lerer , who was in iowa this past week for the clinton campaign rollout , and who analyzes one of the most fascinating balancing acts for the onetime obama 2008 rival who , of course , went on to serve loyally as his secretary of state . `` she embraced key portions of his legacy -- coming out strong for the health care law , for his push for immigration legislation -- but it was n't all sunshine and light , '' said lerer . `` she also took subtle digs at his leadership style -- she said america was on the wrong track -- i ca n't believe i 'm saying this but at times she sounded almost like a republican . '' 3 . in big policy choice , clinton signals an important campaign focus . in democratic politics , kamala is the harris sister who gets the most national buzz . but maya harris is about to play a big role in the question of how hillary clinton plots her path to 270 electoral votes . kamala harris is the california attorney general and a 2016 senate candidate , for the seat being vacated by democrat barbara boxer . maya harris just signed on for a top policy role in the clinton campaign -- and cnn 's nia-malika henderson reports it is a hiring with a clear message . `` one clue , i think , is maya harris , '' said henderson . `` her resume is really a liberal 's dream . she has worked at the center for american progress , aclu , she 's also done work on community policing and police reforming , and she also has a very interesting paper that looks at the importance of women of color to the electorate . '' `` so i think this hire is going to be really interesting in what it means for the kind of policy initiatives that hillary clinton rolls out and the sort of appeals she makes to women of color , who are so crucial to getting the obama coalition back together again . '' 4 . walker-rubio ? rubio-walker ? a general contrast with some gop buzz . marco rubio drew a direct generational contrast with hillary clinton when he officially joined the gop 2106 race , and wisconsin gov. scott walker also often talks of his hope republicans will look for a next-generation leader as their next presidential nominee . in political circles -- meaning among junkies and strategists -- there is constant debate about potential tickets -- at this stage of the process a hypothetical and then some because neither man has been tested on the trail . but jonathan martin of the new york times says his recent travels suggest the talk about a walker-rubio pairing is not limited to inside the beltway chatter . `` they both would offer that kind of generational dynamic in the same way that clinton and gore did ... in 1992 , '' said martin . `` but what 's interesting is , in new hampshire over the weekend , i was there for the big cattle call of all the candidates , for the first time from an actual activist -- not an operative but an activist -- i heard somebody float the idea of a walker-rubio race in 2016 . '' 5 . iowa , new hampshire , south carolina and then ? heading into the 2016 cycle , the republican national committee used its muscle to make some changes to the presidential nominating process , including fewer sanctioned debates and a primary calendar that was less front-loaded . now , some big gop establishment figures are worried the changes could help candidates who make the establishment cringe -- especially texas sen. ted cruz . iowa , new hampshire and south carolina keep their traditional slots at the front end of the calendar . florida is usually the next big contest , but it could be eclipsed by -- sports fans will get this -- what is becoming known as the `` sec primary . '' it is important to note the exact calendar is still a work in progress . but what worries the establishment is the likelihood of a super tuesday -- or maybe back-to-back tuesdays -- in early march that include a number of conservative southern states : alabama , arkansas , tennessee , texas , georgia , maybe louisiana . the shift is one reason former arkansas gov. mike huckabee thinks the 2016 environment could be more favorable to him than 2008 . ditto for rick santorum . they did well in the south , but it did n't matter much because john mccain and mitt romney , respectively , were well on their way to the nomination by the time those bruises were inflicted . again , there might yet be more changes . but more and more leading establishment figures are grumbling changes designed with the best of intentions might end up hurting their favorites -- people like jeb bush or marco rubio -- and helping those with strong evangelical connections -- like huckabee and cruz .O\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' `` we were there . we lived it . the defendant murdered our 8-year-old son , maimed our 7-year-old daughter , and stole part of our soul .

'' we 're playing checkers on the middle east game board and tehran 's playing three-dimensional chess . iran has no problem reconciling its bad and contradictory behavior while we twist ourselves into knots over our tough choices , all the while convincing ourselves that america 's policy on the nuclear issue is on the right track . iran is n't 10 feet tall in this region , but by making the nuclear issue the be-all and end-all that is supposed to reduce iran 's power , the united states is only making tehran taller . consider the following : . the u.s.-iranian relationship is not symmetrical . it 's not as if we both are doing terrible things and are looking for a fair and equitable compromise to stop our respective bad behaviors . iran is about to try a u.s. citizen and washington post reporter and we have made a judgment that even while we protest , we will keep the nuclear issue separated not just from this case but from iran 's serial abuse of human rights , including the behavior of its shia militias in iraq . i can only hope there is a carefully orchestrated behind-the-scenes plan to have iran release jason rezaian . if not , we 're legitimizing a bad regime and compromising u.s. values and interests in the process by not ensuring that all americans being held by iran come out as part of the nuclear deal . america is alienating some of our closest allies because of the iran deal , and iran is picking up new ones and bolstering relations with old ones who are growing more dependent because they see iran 's power rising . our friends are n't perfect , particularly the saudis and even the israelis . but we need them precisely because iran is rising . sadly , the administration is sending signals that cutting a deal on the nuclear issue takes precedence over their priorities . in the meantime , iran 's allies , bashar al-assad 's syria , hezbollah and now the houthis -- not proxies , but instruments of convenience -- see what 's happening and are willing to play and cooperate even more in the iranian game . the russians , too , realize that the nuclear issue gives them cover to sell sophisticated missile defense systems and soon to export even more to gain influence and hard currency . we 're losing friends ; iran is gaining them . and in one of the cruelest ironies , iran 's way back into the global economy is as a result of the very issue that made it such a pariah : the nuclear issue . as the arab world melts down and lacks a traditional epicenter of strength and power , -lrb- egypt , iraq , syria -rrb- , iran is rising . the argument here is not that iran is taking over the middle east . but in its zone of influence , a zone critical to the united states -- syria , iraq , the gulf , yemen , lebanon -- it is expanding its influence , not contracting . washington does n't play this kind of game well . it is tripping all over itself trying to figure out how to combat isis in syria and yet not empower al-assad -lrb- no answer -rrb- , how to combat isis in iraq without favoring the shia-dominated government and alienating iraqi sunnis -lrb- no answer -rrb- and how to backstop the saudis in yemen without enabling them to make matters worse through their airstrikes -lrb- no answer -rrb- . iran has a much easier time managing contradictions . indeed , it can use the threat of isis to keep the americans away from weakening their ally al-assad as well as expand its influence in iraq under the guise of fighting a battle of mutual interest . battle group naval assets to the gulf of aden notwithstanding , the united states is being outfoxed , not outgunned . do n't expect u.s. ships to stop those of iran . as state department spokesperson marie harf said , `` there are reports about these u.s. ships that have been moved and i want to be very clear just so that no one has the wrong impression . they are not there to intercept iranian ships . the purpose of moving them is only to ensure that the shipping lanes remain open and safe . i think there was some misreporting and confusion on this . i just want to be very clear that the purpose is not to do anything in terms of those iranian ships . '' it clearly makes sense to try to use diplomacy as a way to constrain iran 's nuclear program . but we should have no illusions about two things . first , we wo n't end teheran 's nuclear weapons pretensions , and two , we are and will be enabling its rise in the region because of this nuclear diplomacy , not constraining it . one of the reasons the united states wo n't strike al-assad is for fear of emboldening isis , but the other is that we do n't want a proxy war with iran in syria . as the russians have made clear in their recent s-300 deal , the nuclear negotiations are only making iran a more acceptable business partner . and the real fruits of the diplomacy have n't even begun yet . sanctions relief will make the mullahs more secure and give them the resources to buck up , not tamp down , their regional aspirations . we 've made our bed , apparently , and now are going to have to find a way to sleep . a nuclear deal will avert a crisis over the nuclear issue for now . but unless it really does change iran 's behavior , we 've only bought ourselves a bigger one down the road .\\xd3\\x17\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xed--lrb- cnn -rrb- if someone told you that your city had started a program providing clean needles to injecting drug users , would that make you want to start injecting drugs yourself ? the answer , of course , would be no . yet for decades , many have stood by the belief that such programs , known as syringe exchange or syringe services programs , promote and encourage drug use . indeed , for congress , it became the rationale behind a ban implemented in 1988 that prohibits the use of federal funds for these programs . but an overwhelming body of scientific evidence continues to show that this is simply not true . as a result of the recent spikes in hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in rural indiana and kentucky , the controversial topic of syringe exchange programs has come to the fore again . and this time , scientific evidence and sound public health practices prevailed as both states authorized the implementation of syringe exchange programs to help curb the spread of these two blood-borne diseases that can be spread by contaminated syringes . this is a welcome step -- an estimated 50,000 americans are newly infected with hiv every year , and some 8 % are among injection drug users . meanwhile , between 2006 and 2012 , at least 30 states experienced increases in hepatitis c infection rates , with more than half reporting at least a 200 % increase in acute infections among young adults . overall , the prevalence of acute hepatitis c among people under 30 rose from 36 % to 49 % in six years . with such numbers in mind , the recent national spotlight on syringe services programs offers a critical opportunity for us to reignite a much-needed conversation . dozens of studies have demonstrated conclusively how effective syringe services programs have been in the fight against hiv and hepatitis c transmission among injection drug users by reducing the reuse and sharing of dirty syringes -- without increasing drug use . in addition to helping curb the spread of these diseases by offering access to sterile syringes , these programs promote public health and safety by taking syringes off the streets and protecting law enforcement personnel and others , including children , from injuries . they also offer preventive health services , such as hiv testing and counseling , and form vital bridges to drug treatment , overdose prevention , housing and employment services . for states such as new york and washington -- early adopters of these interventions -- syringe services programs have played a crucial role in driving down hiv transmission among injecting drug users . washington was the first state in the united states to implement an syringe exchange when it opened a syringe services program in tacoma in 1988 . in new york city -- where half of all injection drug users were hiv positive in the 1980s -- state lawmakers authorized syringe exchange in 1992 to combat the disease , deeming it a `` public health necessity . '' the expansion of these programs in new york was followed by a dramatic reduction in hiv incidence among injecting drug users , declining from 54 % in 1990 to 13 % in 2001 ; hepatitis c prevalence declined from 90 % to 63 % during this period . because they work , syringe services programs will likely be an integral part of the statewide plans announced by new york gov. andrew cuomo and washington gov. jay inslee to reduce new hiv infections dramatically by 2020 . syringe exchange programs not only save lives , but also save millions of dollars in hiv treatment costs . while a clean syringe costs less than 50 cents , the average lifetime cost of treating an hiv-positive person is estimated to be around $ 425,000 . as hiv-positive injection drug users report higher levels of unemployment and homelessness , public programs such as medicaid will ultimately become responsible for the expensive treatment costs . for example , an analysis by johns hopkins university researchers showed that expanding the availability of syringe services programs to cover just 10 % of all injections in the united states would prevent almost 500 new hiv infections among drug users per year . this translates into $ 193 million in savings reaped from averted treatment costs after an estimated $ 64 million investment . in other words , every dollar spent on syringe exchange saves between $ 3 and $ 7 in hiv treatment costs alone . despite such evidence , syringe services programs are continually caught in the political crossfire . a longstanding ban , temporarily lifted in 2009 and then reinstated by congress as part of 2010 budget negotiations , prevents state and local jurisdictions from spending their federal health dollars on these programs . lifting the ban will not cost any additional money -- it simply allows states to spend their federally allocated dollars on syringe services programs , if they choose to do so . why is this important ? the federal government provides the majority of funding for all hiv prevention services . without access to federal funding , more than 200 syringe service programs in 34 states , washington , d.c. , and puerto rico are operating on shoestring budgets from local and state governments . this has forced syringe services programs across the country to cut staff , scale down services and potentially shut their doors for good . meanwhile , the new hiv and hepatitis c infections among injecting drug users in primarily rural states , such as in indiana or kentucky , show that the landscape of injection drug use in america is rapidly changing . we have a chance right now to get ahead of the curve and avert a nationwide resurgence of hiv and hepatitis c infections through injection drug use . it is time for congress to make sound and effective policy based upon facts rather than discredited assertions or unsubstantiated fears .\\xb9'\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' with groceries in hand , erika 's boyfriend , sean coakley , had arrived at her apartment to make dinner and found erika collapsed on the floor . the fire department and paramedics were already on the scene . the attendant at the front desk had heard erika screaming for help and called 911 . '' -lsb- the paramedics -rsb- tried to revive her with cpr and while they were in the apartment , i think she had a heart attack and then two more on the way to the hospital in the ambulance , and another one in the hospital , and she never woke up , '' erika 's father , rick langhart , said . karen knew it was serious when the emergency room doctor said they needed to come to the hospital in arlington , virginia . she said the doctor asked her whether erika was using any birth control . according to karen , when she told him erika was using the nuvaring , . `` he said well there 's a link between nuvaring and pulmonary embolisms , '' karen langhart said . rick langhart said doctors removed the nuvaring immediately . `` it was , it was a nightmare , '' he added . by the time rick and karen arrived at the virginia hospital center , erika was in a coma , in the icu . `` they had determined that erika had no brain activity and that because of her heart attacks they basically told us that she was brain dead and that 's it , '' rick langhart said , fighting back tears . hospital records cited the nuvaring as a risk factor for erika 's multiple pulmonary embolisms . records confirm what erika 's parents told cnn : that a blood clot started in an artery/vein in her right thigh and traveled to her lungs , causing `` massive '' pulmonary embolisms and `` multiple episodes of cardiac arrest '' on the way to the hospital and overnight . the langharts never heard their daughter 's voice again . she died on thanksgiving . `` we miss her so much , '' karen langhart said . less than a year later , 2,000 miles away in utah , megan henry had the scare of her life . henry , it turns out , was a classmate of erika langhart 's at american university . she 's training to compete in the olympics in skeleton , a type of high-speed downhill sledding . the scare that shook her in august 2012 threatened her olympic dreams . within weeks of starting the nuvaring , henry said she collapsed during training , unable to breathe . `` i mean i was struggling , i was struggling to breathe . '' henry said . `` it 's like an elephant was sitting on my chest all the time . '' after seeing five doctors who were unable to tell her what was wrong , she finally got a diagnosis from a pulmonologist . he told her he thought she had blood clots in her lungs . `` i said , you know i started taking this birth control , is it related to this ? '' henry said . `` and he was like , yeah , i definitely think that you have blood clots and it 's from the birth control . '' x-rays , followed by an ultrasound and a cat scan , revealed that megan 's life was in danger . '' -lsb- the doctor -rsb- started to tell me , you have multiple pulmonary embolisms in both lungs , '' said megan . `` they 're sending an ambulance , they 're going to come and they 're going to rush you to the emergency room ... it just really took me by surprise and you know i knew it was something bad but i never imagined it would be something like that . '' according to her hospital discharge papers , the nuvaring henry was using `` was probably the risk factor '' for her pulmonary embolisms . henry went from peak physical condition to using a breathing machine . she was put on blood thinners , too . her doctors told her it 's too risky to use hormonal birth control again . `` easy . safe . that 's really how it was presented -- easy , safe , low-dose hormone -- you know , and it turns out it was n't . it was n't that at all , '' she said . even though nuvaring has about the same risk for blood clots as newer birth control pills , henry said she wishes she had known that the incidence of life-threatening blood clots is double with nuvaring compared to older birth control pills . `` there are other options out there for birth control that have risks , but not doubling the risks , '' henry told cnn . `` if i would have known that i never would have taken it . '' and thinking about what happened to her classmate , erika , henry said , `` i think if i knew what i know now and , you know , if erika had known that , a number of people , i think that they would have made a slightly different choice . '' the nuvaring is one of the most popular birth control products on the market . a flexible ring inserted vaginally , it releases a combination of hormones . by 2010 as many as 830,000 women were using the vaginal ring as a contraceptive method , according to the guttmacher institute , a nonprofit organization advancing sexual and reproductive health worldwide . at least 10.5 million women use hormonal birth control pills . the nuvaring was approved by the fda in 2001 and became available to women in the united states in 2002 . the dutch pharmaceutical company , organon , developed the device and manufactured it until 2007 when the company was sold to schering plough corporation , which was then acquired by merck in 2009 . according to merck , the nuvaring is sold in more than 50 countries , and 44 million prescriptions have been filled for women in the united states alone . the nuvaring dispenses what 's called a third-generation progestin , or synthetic hormone . when it first came on the market , the device was touted as a breakthrough -- inserted vaginally to release a `` continuous low dose of hormones . '' it stays in for three weeks , so no bother of taking a daily birth control pill . the ring was branded in a television commercial as `` a different way to do birth control '' and `` oh ! it 's easy to use . '' convenient ? absolutely . but safe ? that depends on whom you ask . the langharts had no idea the nuvaring birth control their daughter had been using for four years had already been linked to other women 's deaths , according to unconfirmed claims of problems reported to the fda . merck acknowledges a very small risk of blood clots but stands by its product , saying , `` there is substantial evidence to support the safety and efficacy of nuvaring . '' while studies have shown that the number of severe adverse events is extremely low -- fewer than 11 cases per 10,000 women who use it for a year -- the families who have lost loved ones point out that the incidence of life-threatening blood clots is double with nuvaring than with older birth control pills . since the mid-1990s there have been multiple studies suggesting that while third-generation progestins are generally safe , they are approximately twice as likely to cause blood clots than older , second-generation birth control pills . merck denied cnn 's request for an on-camera interview . instead , it gave this statement : `` while there is a very small risk of a blood clot when using nuvaring or any combined hormonal contraceptive , this risk is much less than the risk of blood clots during pregnancy and the immediate post-partum period . '' among 10,000 women , between five and 20 women run the risk of developing a serious blood clot during pregnancy ; the risk increases to between 40 and 65 women during the 12-week postpartum period . among 10,000 women in a year using combination hormonal contraceptives -- that includes birth control pills , the ring and the patch -- the risk of developing serious blood clots ranges between three and 12 women . nuvaring users are on the higher end of that risk . two studies conducted in 2011 and 2012 reveal the risk of developing a serious blood clot among nuvaring users is 11.4 and 8.3 per 10,000 women in a year , respectively . the nuvaring 's label was updated in 2013 by the fda with information about both studies . the langharts , megan henry , and 3,800 others sued merck . according to claims filed in federal and state courts , the lawsuits allege organon , the original manufacturer of the nuvaring , `` failed to adequately warn consumers about a heightened risk of blood clots associated with the use of nuvaring , even though the manufacturer was aware that nuvaring posed greater risks than other hormonal contraceptives . '' in february , without admitting any wrongdoing , merck agreed to pay $ 100 million in damages . but the langharts did not settle , insisting merck be held accountable for what the family said was merck 's failure to properly warn users of the risk . they believe what merck is getting away with is `` criminal . '' `` i do n't understand why a company in the united states would allow that kind of product on the market . it 's not the way americans do business , '' rick langhart said . `` and for them to do what they do in total disregard for what 's going on . it 's criminal to me . '' instead , to honor erika 's memory , they decided to create a nonprofit to inform women of the dangers they believe are related to the nuvaring and the comparative risks of all forms of hormonal contraceptives . the nonprofit 's name , `` informed choice for amerika , '' honors their daughter 's name .W\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd3*-lrb- cnn -rrb- if one is to believe lawyers for aaron hernandez , the former new england patriots star had no conceivable reason to kill a man who was his friend , his future brother-in-law and a reliable purveyor of the marijuana he chain-smoked . the jury in the high-profile trial resumed deliberations wednesday after deliberating about an hour-and-a-half on tuesday . the way defense lawyer james sultan laid it out for the massachusetts jury in closing arguments earlier tuesday , why would a young man with a $ 40 million contract kill semi-pro player odin lloyd less than a mile from his own home ? why would hernandez leave a marijuana blunt he shared with the victim at the murder scene ? did those who sultan described as inept and biased police officers and prosecutors simply become fixated with the former tight end with a promising future in the national football league ? `` if there was evidence of any reason aaron would have had to murder odin loyd , do n't you think you would have heard about it in nine weeks ? '' sultan asked the jury . `` you did n't hear it because it does n't exist . '' the prosecution , however , portrayed hernandez as cold , calculating and insecure -- a man who believed others should be grateful for his attention , one capable of murder for merely disrespecting him in the presence of others . prosecutor william mccauley asked jurors : what was hernandez talking about a day after lloyd 's bullet-riddled body was found at a massachusetts industrial park in june 2013 ? '' ` my endorsements are gone , ' '' hernandez said , according to mccauley said . `` he 's not talking about odin . '' the state 's largely circumstantial case wrapped up after the testimony of more than 130 witnesses and the presentation of more than 400 pieces of evidence . on monday , hernandez 's defense gave its side of the story in less than a day . in closing arguments the next day , sultan sought to show that prosecutors failed to prove their contention that hernandez orchestrated the killing without a reasonable doubt . even if they found a strong likelihood that hernandez was involved , the lawyer said , `` that 's not enough . '' sultan tried to implicate hernandez 's co-defendants , ernest wallace and carlos ortiz , who have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . the defense described wallace and ortiz as a pair of drug dealers known to become crazed while on pcp , as men capable of killing someone in drug-induced fits of rage . they 're accused of killing lloyd . `` did he make all the right decisions ? no , '' sultan said of his client . `` he was a 23-year-old kid who witnessed something , committed by somebody he knew . he really did n't know what to do , so he put one foot in front of another . keep in mind , he 's not charged with accessory after the fact . ... he 's charged with murder ... and that he did not do . '' the prosecution said wallace and ortiz were longtime friends of hernandez , who had complete control of them . mccauley reminded the jury of testimony about hernandez and his two friends sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies , and hernandez at times leaving his then 8-month-old child with the two men . `` these guys ... will do whatever he wants , '' the prosecutor said of hernandez . the motive for the killing has never been clearly spelled out , but prosecutors said lloyd might have done or said something that did n't sit well with hernandez . they said hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated the killing to settle the score . mccauley said a perceived slight that might seem insignificant to someone -- such as disrespect -- would easily offend hernandez . hernandez 's fiancee , shayanna jenkins , testified that hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple 's home that she said reeked of marijuana . she also said she did n't know what was in the box . the prosecution has said the murder weapon , which has not been recovered , was in the box . after concealing the box with her daughter 's clothing , jenkins said she threw it away in `` a random dumpster '' but could not remember where . another piece of the state 's case was grainy footage from hernandez 's home security system that prosecutors said showed him holding a .45 - caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill lloyd . hernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after lloyd was shot to death in the industrial park , which is about a mile from hernandez 's home . the video is time-stamped minutes after nearby workers described hearing noise they said sounded like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car hernandez was driving . hernandez 's lawyers showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand . they suggested it was an ipad . evidence collected in lloyd 's death investigation led to two more murder charges against hernandez in a separate case in boston . hernandez is also accused of shooting daniel de abreu and safiro furtado , allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub . that double shooting took place in july 2012 , almost a year before lloyd was killed . he will be tried in that case after the lloyd trial . the jury has not heard about the double shooting . cnn 's susan candiotti and laura dolan contributed to this report .c\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' upon making an arrest . among the most popular shows on tv in the early '80s , `` the dukes of hazzard '' ran until 1985 and spawned tv movies , an animated series and video games . several of best 's `` hazzard '' co-stars paid tribute to the late actor on social media . `` i laughed and learned more from jimmie in one hour than from anyone else in a whole year , '' co-star john schneider , who played bo duke , said on twitter . `` give uncle jesse my love when you see him dear friend . '' `` jimmy best was the most constantly creative person i have ever known , '' said ben jones , who played mechanic cooter on the show , in a facebook post . `` every minute of his long life was spent acting , writing , producing , painting , teaching , fishing , or involved in another of his life 's many passions . '' born jewel guy on july 26 , 1926 , in powderly , kentucky , best was orphaned at 3 and adopted by armen and essa best , who renamed him james and raised him in rural indiana . best served in the army during world war ii before launching his acting career . in the 1950s and 1960s , he accumulated scores of credits , playing a range of colorful supporting characters in such tv shows as `` the twilight zone , '' `` bonanza , '' `` the andy griffith show '' and `` gunsmoke . '' he later appeared in a handful of burt reynolds ' movies , including `` hooper '' and `` the end . '' but best will always be best known for his `` hazzard '' role , which lives on in reruns . `` jimmie was my teacher , mentor , close friend and collaborator for 26 years , '' latshaw said . `` i directed two of his feature films , including the recent ` return of the killer shrews , ' a sequel he co-wrote and was quite proud of as he had made the first one more than 50 years earlier .

'' in a statement , illinois state university president larry dietz remembered ward and leetch as `` well-respected and much-loved colleagues in our athletics department '' in the crash near bloomington . `` words can not fully express the grief that is felt in the wake of such a tragedy , '' dietz said . `` we move between shock and profound sadness .

'' the sculpture , a gift to the town from its original owners , has been on display since 2009 . artist dave poulin has `` had plenty of opportunity to step forward , and our last conversation he wanted $ 8,000 to $ 10,000 , '' celoron mayor scott schrecengost said . `` and then he stated that if we did n't have the funds and we did n't like the statue , we should take it down and put it in storage . '' after the story of the statue caught fire online this weekend , poulin publicly apologized monday for his `` most unsettling sculpture '' in a letter to the hollywood reporter . `` i take full responsibility for ` scary lucy , ' though by no means was that my intent or did i wish to disparage in any way the memories of the iconic lucy image , '' poulin wrote in the letter -lrb- pdf -rrb- . `` from the day of its installation , i have shared my disappointment in the final outcome and have always believed it to be by far my most unsettling sculpture , not befitting of lucy 's beauty or my ability as a sculptor . '' poulin said he has been talking to celoron officials for several years about removing and redoing the sculpture . it seems that cost has been the chief barrier . `` it puzzles me when an art work is donated to a community , they accept it , and then get angry and insist you redo the art work at your own expense . '' poulin wrote in the letter . but the recent media attention to the sculpture seems to have changed his mind . `` i am willing to put my time and money into redoing the lucy sculpture and feel confident after ten years i can do a much better job , '' poulin wrote . no thanks , schrecengost said . he said the town is looking for a new sculptor to fix the statue . `` it would be reworked from the shoulders up -- the entire head , neck and shoulders , not just the face , '' schrecengost said in a news release tuesday . the town has set up a post office box for donations , which can also be made through kickstarter . but the controversy may not be over . it seems that nearby jamestown , new york , also has ties to lucille ball 's early years and might be interested in its own tribute to the comedic legend . schrecengost 's tuesday statement referred to an anonymous facebook campaign that he claims is aimed at raising jamestown 's lucille ball profile at the expense of the celoron statue . `` the best place for a life size statue of lucy is right where it is now -- in lucille ball memorial park in her hometown , in the village of celoron , ny , '' he said . cnn 's emanuella grinberg contributed to this story .\\x9c\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' thus began a bloody vicious cycle , with al-shabaab retaliating on kenyan soil with ever more spectacular mass killings . here are some of the most heinous attacks on kenya by the somali terrorist group . early thursday , while many students still slept , at least four gunman burst into a christian prayer service at garissa university college , leading into easter weekend . they shot students and took hostages , whom they herded across campus . as they encountered students , they separated them into muslims and christians . they spared the former , eyewitness joel ayora said . they killed the latter . kenyan special forces moved in at the campus located about 90 miles from somalia 's southern border . they killed four gunman , but not before 147 victims were shot dead . in december , al-shabaab militants carried out the same macabre division of captives by religion at a rock quarry not far from the somali border . they shot christian workers dead , and spared their muslim colleagues . red cross workers counted at least 36 bodies dumped into the quarry . it was eye-for-an-eye retaliation , the militants said , for raids kenyan security forces carried out on mosques intended to weed out extremists . parallel to operation linda nchi , kenya has gone after ethnic somalis within their own borders triggering protest by human rights watch , which has accused the government of ethnic profiling and mistreatment . in a 2011 case , kenyan authorities reportedly rounded up ethnic somalis in garissa and let them sit in the mud , while beating some of them , hrw alleged . passengers on a bus in kenya 's north were told to recite from the quran or die in november 2014 . shortly after the bus carrying some 60 people departed mandera , near somalia 's border , al-shabaab gunmen stopped it in a hilly area and barged in . those who failed to recite verses were gunned down , leaving 28 dead . in its claim of responsibility , al-shabaab said the dead were christians , and their killing was retaliation mosque raids by kenyans . a day after the attack , kenyan security forces retaliated with an offensive across the border into somalia . they claimed to kill 100 al-shabaab militants . in july , al-shabaab gunmen opened fire on the lamu coast , a popular tourist region , and at a police station in a neighboring county . they killed 22 people . last may , tour companies evacuated vacationers from kenya after the uk and united states issued alerts that there was a high threat of attacks . before the garissa massacre , the westgate mall attack was the deepest wound al-shabaab had inflicted on kenya . for four days , four attackers turned the luxury shopping mall in the capital nairobi into a cauldron of blood , smoke and rubble . part of the mall collapsed as kenyan security forces fought for control . at least 61 civilians were killed , as well as a handful of security officers . al-shabaab said the attack was retaliation for kenya participation in africa union military operations in somalia . even with al-shabaab 's shooting in garissa , al qaeda 's bombing of the u.s. embassy in 1998 remains the single bloodiest islamist terror attack on kenyan soil . in short succession , bombs detonated at u.s. embassies in kenya and tanzania back then . the nairobi bombing was much deadlier that the explosion at dar es salaam . al qaeda founding member mamdouh mahmud salim was arrested and accused in the bombing and is being held in a new york jail , where he still awaits trial . he is serving a 32 year sentence after being convicted of stabbing a prison guard there in the eye .o\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the satirical document does have a serious side . an online debate started last month when mehmet karaca , the rector of istanbul technical university , said he would build a mosque on campus if there was enough support . karaca was referencing another petition asking a mosque be built on campus , which almost 200,000 students signed . twenty thousand students at itu also signed a separate petition in response , demanding a buddhist temple on campus . `` i can not fulfill my religious needs '' and can not afford `` to go to the nearest buddhist temple 2,000 miles away , '' utku gurcag boratac from istanbul wrote as her reason for signing . `` i want to fulfill my religious needs on campus , '' said another . this is just the latest flurry in a longstanding discussion around civil and religious freedoms in the secular republic . turkey 's secularist opposition has accused turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and his party , the islamist-based justice and development party , of trying to instill conservative islamic values into everyday life . late last year , the head of turkey 's islamic religious affairs authority , the diyanet , announced plans to build 80 mosques on university campuses across the country . the diyanet sparked discussion a few months earlier by opening a mosque on the campus of erzurum ataturk university in the eastern province of erzurum , according to turkish daily newspaper hurriyet .\\x08 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' even though kurt died in the most horrific way possible , there is this mythology and romanticism that surrounds him , because he 's 27 forever . the shelf life of an artist or musician is n't particularly long . kurt has gotten to icon status because he will never age . he will always be that relevant in that time and always be beautiful . rolling stone : 17 young innovators shaking up the music industry . there is , with any great artist , a little manic-ness and insanity . `` tropic of cancer '' is one of my favorite books . and -lsb- author -rsb- henry miller had this work ethic , where he would get out of bed every day and force himself to write five pages . it taught me that if you do the work , you progress . so many people are content to settle . my dad was exceptionally ambitious . but he had a lot thrown on him , exceeding his ambition . he wanted his band to be successful . but he did n't want to be the f ------ voice of a generation . do you remember the first time you heard a nirvana record -- and knowing that was your father ? i 've talked to sean lennon about this . he had a few more years with his dad that you did . but for him , the records were a road into understanding his father after he was gone . i do n't really like nirvana that much -lsb- grins -rsb- . sorry , promotional people , universal . i 'm more into mercury rev , oasis , brian jonestown massacre -lsb- laughs -rsb- . the grunge scene is not what i 'm interested in . but `` territorial pissings '' -lsb- on nevermind -rsb- is a f ------ great song . and `` dumb '' -lsb- on in utero -rsb- -- i cry every time i hear that song . it 's a stripped-down version of kurt 's perception of himself -- of himself on drugs , off drugs , feeling inadequate to be titled the voice of a generation . rolling stone : elton john , michael stipe defend transgender prisoners ' rights . the irony is that he wrote it before nirvana made nevermind . i know . it was projection , to something . there 's no way anyone can wrap their minds around that . did you feel awkward as a teenager , not being that interested in the music kurt made ? no . i would have felt more awkward if i 'd been a fan . i was around 15 when i realized he was inescapable . even if i was in a car and had the radio on , there 's my dad . he 's larger than life , and our culture is obsessed with dead musicians . we love to put them on a pedestal . if kurt had just been another guy who abandoned his family in the most awful way possible ... but he was n't . he inspired people to put him on a pedestal , to become st. kurt . he became even bigger after he died than he was when he was alive . you do n't think it could have gotten any bigger . but it did . after the first screening i attended , there was a guy who said `` montage of heck '' was a very interesting film about people he did n't like . -lsb- laughs -rsb- that 's a pretty good description . rolling stone : a guide to cobain 's cinematic legacy . i found it interesting that the way morgen told kurt 's story did n't evoke any sympathy for that viewer -- that kurt 's art did not resonate with him . all he saw was a personalty he did n't like . that is an interesting perspective . for me , the film provided a lot more factual information about my father -- not just tall tales that were misconstrued , misremembered , rehashed , retold 10 different ways . it was factual evidence of who my father was as a child , as a teenager , as a man , as a husband , as an artist . it explored every single aspect of who he was as a human being . what was it like hearing his voice ? i 've been hearing his voice forever , through his music . i was thinking more of his speaking voice . his speaking voice is sort of similar to mine . it 's sort of a monotone . the depth to it is similar to the way i speak . i do n't know what the f -- that is . i was n't even talking when he was around . do n't mistake the power of genes . it 's very weird how genes are . dave -lsb- grohl -rsb- , krist -lsb- novoselic -rsb- and pat -lsb- smear -rsb- came over to a house where i was living . it was the first time -lsb- the ex-nirvana members -rsb- had been together in a long time . and they had what i call the `` k. c. jeebies , '' which is when they see me , they see kurt . they look at me , and you can see they 're looking at a ghost . they were all getting the k. c. jeebies hardcore . dave said , `` she is so much like kurt . '' they were all talking amongst themselves , rehashing old stories i 'd heard a million times . i was sitting in a chair , chain-smoking , looking down like this -lsb- affects total boredom -rsb- . and they went , `` you are doing exactly what your father would have done . '' but i was glad they came over -lsb- smiles -rsb- . it was a cool experience , like having a nirvana reunion minus one . except for his spawn . what do you want to do next , now that this film is coming out ? in being one of the executive producers , you 're stepping into the public at almost the same age your father was when he made nirvana 's first album . the timing is ... i like to think of it as poetic . coincidental , yeah . oddly enough , being 22 , it 's the first year a fire has been lit under my ass -- not because of the documentary , just personally . i have this motivation and ambition that i did n't have before : `` i want to go paint this painting . '' the hardest part of doing anything creatively is just getting up and doing . once i get out of bed and get into my art room , i start painting . i 'm there . and i 'm doing it . copyright \\xc2\\xa9 2015 rolling stone .$\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb9\\x1b-lrb- cnn -rrb- unicef said friday that an initial shipment of 16 tons of medical supplies , meant to help 80,000 innocents caught up in the havoc of yemen , had at last landed in yemen 's capital , sanaa . the conflict is exacting a heavy toll on children and families , unicef said in a statement . `` the humanitarian situation is worsening all the time , with increasingly limited access to water , basic sanitation and critical health services , '' the statement quoted unicef yemen representative julien harneis , speaking from amman , jordan , as saying . `` the supplies we have managed to bring in today can make the difference between life and death for children and their families -- but we know they are not enough , and we are planning more of these airlifts . '' aid agencies have been saying that supplies were desperately needed , but getting them into the country in the midst of regional turmoil was difficult . unicef said its cargo included antibiotics , bandages , syringes , iv sets and other medical supplies . included as well , the agency said , were micronutrients for up to 20,000 children and water storage materials airlifted through djibouti from unicef 's supply center in denmark . also friday , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees said that about 900 refugees from yemen have arrived in the horn of africa . many more are reportedly trying to make the trip but are hampered by fuel shortages and high fees by boat operators . `` unhcr is extremely concerned about the dangers for anyone trying to flee across the red sea and gulf of aden , where there are no search and rescue operations , '' the agency said in a statement . `` last year , 246 lives were reported lost in sea crossings to yemen . unhcr appeals to all ships in the area to be extra vigilant and assist any boats in distress . we also ask that countries with vessels in waters near yemen -- including surveillance and anti-piracy vessels -- instruct their ships to help with rescues . '' it said that , as demand increases , the boats attempting the dangerous crossing are likely to become more crowded -- a crossing that has historically been made in the other direction , by people fleeing africa in favor of yemen . many yemenis are attempting the trip in rickety fishing boats . one family told cnn the crossing was `` a window into hell . '' and underscoring the increasing toll being exacted by the conflict in yemen , the world health organization said friday that at least 643 people have been killed in the country since the fighting escalated three weeks ago . but it acknowledged that the number was almost certainly an underestimate . `` as of 6 april 2015 there have been a total of 643 deaths and 2,226 injuries , '' the who , the health arm of the united nations , said in a statement . `` casualty estimates are likely to change in the coming days as additional cases are verified and reported . '' the figures cover the period from march 19 to april 6 . they include , however , only deaths and injuries verified by a health facility . other deaths and injuries have undoubtedly occurred . security in the country , which is on the arabian peninsula , deteriorated sharply last month when houthi rebels advanced on sanaa and the port city of aden , forcing president abdu rabu mansour hadi to flee the country . since then , saudi arabia has launched airstrikes meant to halt the advance of the houthis . in at least one case , according to houthi sources , one of those strikes hit a school .\\xc2\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' slager was proficient with the nonlethal taser . according to personnel records , he scored 50 out of 50 on a taser certification exam in 2011 . before the officer starts firing at scott , the video shows a dark object falling behind him and hitting the ground . it 's not clear whether that is the taser . later in the video , when slager approaches scott 's body , he drops a dark object next to the man . again , it 's not clear whether that 's the taser . it 's unknown whether scott took the officer 's taser or whether the officer picked the object up and moved it closer to the body . slager was named in a police complaint in 2013 after he allegedly `` tased a man for no reason '' before slamming him to the ground and dragging him , according to the north charleston police department . at the time , slager was searching for a suspect who was described as being 5-feet-5-inches tall . the african-american man he confronted was 6-feet-3 inches tall . a lawyer for the man who filed the complaint , mario givens , said his client plans to file a lawsuit . `` the citizens of north charleston should n't have to live in the fear , '' the lawyer , eduardo curry , told reporters thursday . givens said slager came to his door , ordered him out of the house and then tased him . `` it was painful , '' he said . `` i fell . i have a couple bruises . '' slager was later cleared in that incident . `` i was upset , '' givens said . `` they took a real long time to even investigate the case . '' in another complaint in january , slager was cited for failing to file a report after an african-american woman called police because her children were being harassed . slager had worked as a waiter before joining the military , records show . he served in the u.s. coast guard from 2003 to 2009 , according to a job application filed with the north charleston police department . that application , filed in january 2009 , said slager had not been convicted of a felony in the past seven years . personnel documents describe slager as `` enthused '' when he joined the force and said he demonstrated `` great officer safety tactics '' in dealing with suspects . south carolina senators , governor condemn police shooting . slager 's annual in-service mandatory training included a range of topics from first aid to firearms and taser use . slager passed his certifications . in august , slager passed a firearms qualification . from 2009 to 2014 , slager qualified in the use of his glock firearm . he received and passed yearly training in `` bias based profiling '' and `` ethics , '' the documents said . he also was certified by the s.c. criminal justice academy in march 2013 as having `` met and successfully completed the in-service requirements '' as a law enforcement officer . slager completed a separate 10-hour `` active shooter incident response training '' course in december 2013 . according to the documents , slager was involved in a `` nonpreventable '' traffic accident last year when a motorist with his car in reverse struck the officer 's patrol car . the driver fled the scene . since graduating from the police academy in 2010 , a supervisor twice noted in training reports that he `` spoke with -lrb- slager -rrb- in reference to certain procedures in reference to conducting motor vehicle stops and citizen contacts . '' no other details were provided . slager signed his oath of office with the police force on march 1 , 2010 , pledging to `` faithfully serve the citizens of this city '' and `` never abuse my authority either by words or acts .

'' key publicly apologized to bailey , a waitress at his local cafe , for repeatedly tugging on her ponytail , after she complained about his behavior in a blog post . the post , published on new zealand political website the daily blog , says that the odd behavior began during last year 's election season . it was `` hardly an acceptable form of greeting , '' bailey wrote . she wrote that while she did n't directly make her objections clear verbally , her body language `` screamed ' i do n't like that . ' '' `` as he approached me , he thought it would be fitting to raise his hands high and make scary , suspense sound effects , like the music from the movie ` jaws ' , '' read the post . `` as he towered overhead i slunk down , cringing , whilst -lrb- key 's wife -rrb- bronagh told him to ` leave the poor girl alone . ' '' the behavior carried on for a number of months and on several occasions , the post states . eventually the cafe 's manager made it clear to key that his actions were unwelcome . key , who regularly visits the auckland cafe with his wife , told reporters that his behavior was in the context of `` a bit of banter , '' but said that he had apologized when it was clear she had taken offense . the blog post says that the prime minister offered the offended waitress two bottles of his own jk 2012 pinot noir wine by way of apology . `` we have lots of fun and games there , there 's always lots of practical jokes and things . it 's a very warm and friendly relationship , '' he told reporters in los angeles en route to anzac day commemorations in gallipoli , turkey . `` but if you look at it now , no . when i realized she took offense by that i just sort of immediately went back , gave her some wine , apologized and said i was terribly sorry . '' politicians and public figures also rounded on key , with green mp metiria turei saying that the prime minister should be held to the same standards of behavior as the rest of the electorate . `` a lot of new zealanders know what it 's like to feel as if you 're not taken seriously in a job . as politicians , our job is to make people feel safe at work , not bullied , '' new zealand media reported her as saying . `` it 's a sign of how out of touch john key has become when he ca n't even monitor how inappropriate his personal behavior is , and when people are not comfortable with how he is behaving . '' jackie blue , head of the equal employment opportunities commission , echoed the sentiment . `` it 's never ok to touch someone without their permission , '' tvnz reported her as saying . `` there are no exceptions . '' political analyst bryce edwards told the network that the `` strangeness factor '' of the accusation would haunt key . `` a lot of people will be laughing at john key , that 's harder to recover from , '' he said in a segment . the national council of women of new zealand , while accepting that key was joking and did not mean to offend , criticized the premier . `` the fact that our prime minister has joined the list of people outed for sexism highlights how much sexism is a part of our culture . and it starts at the top , '' the organization 's chief executive sue mccabe wrote in an open letter . `` up and down this country , day after day , people are touched without giving their consent . at one end of the scale , it is an unwelcome pull on a ponytail . at the other end , it 's our shocking levels of violence against women .

'' the suspects were associates of 18-year-old nadun haider , who was killed while stabbing officers at a police station in september , police said . abbott lamented a string of extremist attacks on australian soil . in december , australian authorities stormed a sydney chocolate cafe where a self-styled muslim cleric had been holding hostages , killing the gunman . two of the 17 hostages initially held by the gunman died . in february , two men were charged with plotting terror activities in sydney . despite distancing the suspects from religion , abbott did make a connection to the middle east . `` there are now about a hundred australians who are fighting with terrorists in the middle east , '' and another 150 people in australia support them with funds and recruiting , the prime minister said . in february , abbott announced tougher citizenship laws as a part of the government 's new counterterrorism strategy . authorities have suspended australian passports of those they suspect of terrorist activity . australians should be stoic about the threat of terrorism , abbott said saturday . `` the best thing you can do in the face of those who would do us harm is live your life normally . '' he asked australians to turn out in droves on anzac day . police said this particular threat had been fully contained .e\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x9b2-lrb- cnn -rrb- i do n't always talk about news events with my daughters , but there was something about the story of espn reporter britt mchenry and the wildly offensive way she spoke to that towing company employee that made me bring it up . one of the main things i preach to my girls , ages 7 and 9 , is the importance of respecting other people , no matter who you are and what you go on to accomplish . it 's something that my husband and i just do -- we show respect to everyone from a taxi driver to a teacher to the president of the united states . let me say right here that i have lost my cool from time to time , whether it 's been a phone call with a credit card company to complain about late fees or an experience of bad service at a restaurant . in those cases , when i feel like i 'm going to pop , i keep saying , `` this is unacceptable , this is unacceptable , '' and either hang up in disgust or storm off . -lrb- not perfect ways of handling these incidents , but at no time would i ever think to insult or demean the other person in these situations . -rrb- . some of mchenry 's comments , such as how she 's `` on television , '' imply that she may have the dangerous thinking that she , by dint of her career , education and income , is better than people who do n't get paid what she does or have the same kind of career or educational opportunities . mchenry showed that she either forgot those `` golden rule '' lessons from childhood or that she has n't really lived her life with that mantra . mchenry has since apologized on twitter , saying she said `` some insulting and regrettable things , '' and that as frustrated as she was during an experience at a towing company in virginia , she should `` always choose to be respectful and take the high road . '' but it 's not clear that apology will satisfy anyone who watched the video of her exchange with the towing company worker . `` i see this britt mchenry video , and think : it 's not just about how a celebrity should n't act in public , it 's how all of us should n't act , '' wrote `` cait '' on twitter . said `` shannon , '' also on twittter , `` i had no idea who britt mchenry was before but ... now i know she 's the kind of woman i hope i 've taught my daughters not to be . '' `` her language and disdain brings shame on her , her profession , and her employer . people do n't all of sudden have such a vile tirade . this comes after years of practice and a pattern of similar behaviors . let 's let her be an example to others , '' wrote c cooper on a change.org petition asking mchenry 's employers to fire her . the mchenry story seemed to strike a chord in our household because my older daughter asked what was going to happen to her . this morning , i told her mchenry was suspended for a week by espn , and that led to another conversation . my kids seemed to get it and many celebrities also seem to remember to `` treat other people the way you would want them to treat you '' even in uncomfortable moments . celebrity apologies : the good , bad and uncomfortable . so , britt mchenry , check out these examples of how the rich , famous and powerful handled stressful situations with grace and dignity . after british journalist katie hopkins seriously fat-shamed pop music star kelly clarkson , saying a host of insulting things about the singer 's weight , clarkson won praise for her graceful response . `` that 's because she does n't know me . i 'm awesome . it does n't bother me . it 's a free world . say what you will . i 've just never cared what people think , '' she said . a college baseball player gets suspended for calling little league baseball phenom mo ` ne davis a `` slut . '' her response ? she emailed bloomsburg university asking that the college reinstate him . `` everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance , '' davis , the first girl to earn a win and to pitch a shutout in little league world series history , told espn . '' ... i know right now he 's really hurt and i know how hard he worked to get where he is . i mean , i was pretty hurt on my part but i know he 's hurting even more . '' when an argentinian journalist wrote an open letter to pope francis expressing concern about the pontiff meeting with the country 's president ahead of the general election in october and possibly influencing the outcome , what did the pope do ? well , he picked up the phone and gave the journalist a call . wish we could have been a fly on the wall for that conversation ! the pope appears to have been more than graceful , because after the conversation , the journalist pledged to learn how to pray . when queen bey faced immense criticism after allegedly lip-synching the national anthem in honor of president obama 's inauguration in 2013 , she did n't come out swinging . instead , she admitted to singing along with her `` pre-recorded track '' at the inauguration but only after she opened her news conference with what was described as a stirring , a cappella rendition of the national anthem . finally , reese witherspoon may be the closest example for mchenry to consider when it comes to overcoming a very offensive episode . when witherspoon and her husband were pulled over in 2013 for suspicion of driving under the influence , the academy award winning actress was recorded making comments to the officer such as , `` do you know who i am ? '' and `` you 're about to find out who i am . '' she ultimately issued an apologetic statement , and then went on morning television to apologize some more . `` we went out to dinner in atlanta , and we had one too many glasses of wine , and we thought we were fine to drive and we absolutely were not , '' she said on `` good morning america . '' `` it 's completely unacceptable , and we are so sorry and embarrassed . we know better , and we should n't have done that . '' and , she added , `` when a police officer tells you to stay in the car , you stay in the car . i learned that for sure , '' she told the gma host . now , did mchenry learn that when a towing company worker or anyone else makes you incredibly angry , you never berate them for their weight , job , appearance and income ? let 's hope so . can you think of other examples where the rich and powerful responded to a stressful situation with grace instead of disrespect ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .\\xd9\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

there are two others that emerged in 2014 , nate mantua of the southwest fisheries science center -- part of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -lrb- noaa -rrb- -- said in september . one is in the bering sea and the other is off the coast of southern california . waters in the blob have been warmer by about 5.5 degrees , a significant rise . a recent set of studies published in geophysical research letters by bond 's group points to a high-pressure ridge over the west coast that has calmed ocean waters for two winters . the result was more heat staying in the water because storms did n't kick up and help cool the surface water . `` the warmer temperatures we see now are n't due to more heating , but less winter cooling , '' a recent news release from the university of washington announcing the studies said . the university has worked with noaa on the research . according to new scientist magazine , some marine species are exploring the warmer waters , leading some fish to migrate hundreds of miles from their normal habitats . the magazine cited fisherman and wildlife officials in alaska who have seen skipjack tuna and thresher sharks . pygmy killer whales have been spotted off the coast of washington . `` i 've never seen some of these species here before , '' bill peterson of the northwest fisheries science center in seattle told the new scientist . and he was worried about the adult pacific salmon that normally feed on tiny crustaceans and other food sources that are not around in the same numbers off the coast of the pacific northwest . `` they had nothing to eat , '' he told the magazine of last year 's conditions in the blob . it appears that food has moved to cooler waters . in january , bond told the chinook observer in long beach , washington , that his concern is for very young salmon that are still upstream . `` in particular , the year class that would be going to sea next spring , '' he said . noaa said in a news release last month that california sea lion pups have been found extremely underweight and dying , possibly because of an ocean with fewer things to eat . `` we have been seeing emaciated or dehydrated sea lions show up on beaches , '' justin greenman , assistant stranding coordinator for noaa on the west coast , told cnn . the numbers are overwhelming facilities that care for the stranded sea lions , most of whom are pups , local officials said . record number of sea lion pups stranded in california . the blob also is affecting life on land . for the past few years , that persistent ridge of high pressure has kept the west dry and warm , exacerbating the drought in california , oregon and washington . one of the primary problems is small snow accumulation in the mountains . in early april , officials measured the snowpack in california at a time when it should be the highest . this year it hit an all-time low at 1.4 inches of water content in the snow , just 5 % of the annual average . the previous low for april 1 had been 25 % in 1977 and 2014 . -lrb- pdf -rrb- . gov. jerry brown , in announcing water restrictions the same day , stood on a patch of dry , brown grass in the sierra nevada mountains that is usually blanketed by up to 5 feet of snow . low california snowpack ushers mandatory water restrictions . the heat has caused rising air , which can lead to conditions that produce more thunderstorms . with warmer air in california , areas at higher elevations that usually see snow have seen rain instead . that has led to the lower snowpack and helped compound the drought . the storms also mean more lightning and more wildfires . and the blob affects people on other areas of the country . that same persistent jet stream pattern has allowed cold air to spill into much of the midwest and east . this stuck pattern has led to the record cold and snow in the midwest and northeast over the last two seasons with record snows we have seen in boston and detroit , and the most snow we have seen in decades for cities such as chicago . the weather pattern is confusing the experts . there are some that think it might be a pacific decadal oscillation , a long-lasting el nino-like pattern in the pacific . dennis hartmann , a professor of atmospheric science at the university of washington , does n't believe the answer is clear . `` i do n't think we know ... '' he said in the university 's news release . `` maybe it will go away quickly and we wo n't talk about it anymore , but if it persists for a third year , then we 'll know something really unusual is going on .

'' `` there are limitations on the amount of cargo that can be trans-shipped , '' he added . in total , tristan da cunha is made up of four islands . tristan is the largest land mass and the only one to house people . two more unpopulated islands , nightingale and inaccessible , lie close by . a third , gough , is situated roughly 230 miles away . both gough and inaccessible are unesco world heritage sites . the closest mainland port is cape town , south africa , some seven days sailing time and 1,750 miles north-east . tristan already has a pub , shop , cafe , dance hall , museum , catholic church and swimming pool . there are also two expatriate doctors , two tristanian nurses and school teachers with some 30 students of varying ages . the island 's main industry is lobster fishing , with exports reaching as far afield as the u.s. , australia , japan and the eu thanks to a fishing company that has exclusive rights to fish in the surrounding waters . tristan earns additional income from the sale of unique stamps , coins and handicraft souvenirs , mitcham explained . modest revenue also flows from tourism and visitor accommodation . `` as it is the remotest inhabited island in the world , the tristanians are already very self sufficient , being able to produce many of their own foodstuffs -lrb- like fish , livestock and potatoes -rrb- , '' mitcham said . however , the cost of living has increased in recent years , he added . with limited transport and communication links , the islanders are also keen to see how they can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels , improve the energy efficiency of properties and reduce imports . `` we are slowly updating 40-year old infrastructure , '' mitcham said of the last time the island experienced a major redesign . that modernization happened roughly a decade after the island was evacuated temporarily due to ongoing volcanic activity . before that period , the main way for the islanders to communicate with the outside world was by morse code . things have already changed a lot since then , however . `` a new water system , electrical system and waste water system have just been completed , '' mitcham said . `` and with the 200th anniversary of the founding of tristan -lrb- 2016 -rrb- almost upon us it is an appropriate time to look at new initiatives that may be able to help the future viability of the community . '' interested architects have until mid-june to submit their initial ideas . the best will be whittled down to an initial 20 and then five after further analysis between june and september . porter and mitcham say the islanders will have to apply to the uk and possibly the eu for grants to fund the project . the winner is penciled in to be announced in june 2016 . the most important aspect for applicants is to `` identify cost-effective and practical solutions to improve the energy efficiency -lrb- through renewable energy sources -rrb- of properties , '' mitcham said `` as well as modernizing ... government structures .

      "b\"\\x8d&-lrb- cnn -rrb- the mass killings of armenians in the ottoman empire , which began 100 years ago friday , is said by some scholars and others to have been the first genocide of the 20th century , even though the word `` genocide '' did not exist at the time . the issue of whether to call the killings a genocide is emotional , both for armenians , who are descended from those killed , and for turks , the heirs to the ottomans . for both groups , the question touches as much on national identity as on historical facts . some armenians feel their nationhood can not be fully recognized unless the truth of what happened to their forebears is acknowledged . some turks still view the armenians as having been a threat to the ottoman empire in a time of war , and say many people of various ethnicities -- including turks -- were killed in the chaos of war . in addition , some turkish leaders fear that acknowledgment of a genocide could lead to demands for huge reparations . so , what do we know about happened in those fateful days ? here are some answers : . the ottoman turks , having recently entered world war i on the side of germany and the austro-hungarian empire , were worried that armenians living in the ottoman empire would offer wartime assistance to russia . russia had long coveted control of constantinople -lrb- now istanbul -rrb- , which controlled access to the black sea -- and therefore access to russia 's only year-round seaports . many historians agree that the number was about 2 million . however , victims of the mass killings also included some of the 1.8 million armenians living in the caucasus under russian rule , some of whom were massacred by ottoman forces in 1918 as they marched through east armenia and azerbaijan . by 1914 , ottoman authorities were already portraying armenians as a threat to the empire 's security . then , on the night of april 23-24 , 1915 , the authorities in constantinople , the empire 's capital , rounded up about 250 armenian intellectuals and community leaders . many of them ended up deported or assassinated . april 24 , known as red sunday , is commemorated as genocide remembrance day by armenians around the world . friday is the 100th anniversary of that day . this is a major point of contention . estimates range from 300,000 to 2 million deaths between 1914 and 1923 , with not all of the victims in the ottoman empire . but most estimates -- including one of 800,000 between 1915 and 1918 , made by ottoman authorities themselves -- fall between 600,000 and 1.5 million . whether due to killings or forced deportation , the number of armenians living in turkey fell from 2 million in 1914 to under 400,000 by 1922 . almost any way one can imagine . while the death toll is in dispute , photographs from the era document some mass killings . some show ottoman soldiers posing with severed heads , others with them standing amid skulls in the dirt . the victims are reported to have died in mass burnings and by drowning , torture , gas , poison , disease and starvation . children were reported to have been loaded into boats , taken out to sea and thrown overboard . rape , too , was frequently reported . in addition , according to the website armenian-genocide . org , `` the great bulk of the armenian population was forcibly removed from armenia and anatolia to syria , where the vast majority was sent into the desert to die of thirst and hunger . '' no . genocide was not even a word at the time , much less a legally defined crime . the word `` genocide '' was invented in 1944 by a polish lawyer named raphael lemkin to describe the nazis ' systematic attempt to eradicate jews from europe . he formed the word by combining the greek word for race with the latin word for killing . genocide became a crime in 1948 , when the united nations approved the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide . the definition included acts meant `` to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group . '' armenia , the vatican , the european parliament , france , russia and canada . germany is expected to join that group on friday , the 100th anniversary of the start of the killings . turkey , the united states , the european commission , the united kingdom and the united nations . a u.n. subcommittee called the killings genocide in 1985 , but current u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon declines to use the word . also , a year ago , on the eve of the 99th anniversary of red sunday , then-turkish prime minister -lrb- now-president -rrb- recep tayyip erdogan offered condolences for the mass killings , which he said had `` inhumane consequences . '' while turkey vehemently continues to reject the word `` genocide , '' his remarks went further than those of any previous turkish leader in acknowledging the suffering of armenians .t\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x8f@new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- wall street is more than ready for hillary clinton . the former secretary of state confirmed on sunday what the political world has expected for months -- eight years after her first failed white house bid , clinton will once again seek the democratic party 's nomination for president . `` i 'm hitting the road to earn your vote , because it 's your time , '' clinton said in a video released sunday afternoon officially kicking off her campaign . `` and i hope you 'll join me on this journey . '' as clinton sets off onto the campaign trail to reintroduce herself to voters and court donors across the country , wall street elites are ready to roll out the red carpet . but while the enthusiastic support from the industry will be a financial boon for clinton 's newly launched campaign , it will also pose a delicate balancing act when it comes to appeasing a vocal wing of her party that is antagonistic toward the banking sector . clinton , 67 , has long enjoyed a close relationship with the financial industry . as a new york senator for almost a decade , she represented wall street and courted the industry aggressively during her last presidential campaign . and there is a certain degree of nostalgia within the industry for her husband 's two-term presidency , marked by the 1990s bull market and broad financial deregulation , including the repeal of the glass-steagall act , which separated commercial banking from riskier investing activities . now clinton 's allies in the finance world are eager to galvanize a broad network of potential donors in new york and beyond . many on wall street and in the broader business community view her as a dependable , business-friendly force within a democratic party that has grown increasingly populist during president barack obama 's time in office . robert wolf , the former ceo of ubs americas and a close obama associate who will back clinton in 2016 , said there 's an `` incredible amount of enthusiasm '' for her campaign to get off the ground . `` we know the secretary from the years of being first lady to the senator to the secretary , so we have decades of working relationship with her , '' wolf , who now runs a boutique consulting firm headquartered in manhattan , told cnn . `` i do n't think it 's surprising that the former senator of new york is close to the finance community . '' longtime clinton friend and prominent democratic fundraiser alan patricof , who founded the venture capital firm greycroft partners , said clinton has `` an enormous following '' both inside and outside of the finance world . `` there are a lot of people who perhaps did n't know her as well before who are all set to jump on the bandwagon , '' patricof said . as compared with 2008 , he added : `` there is no diminishment , just the opposite -- an acceleration of interest in her running for the presidency . '' but the fanfare wo n't sit well with everyone . the former first lady 's perceived coziness with wall street is a source of irritation for liberal activists , who hope to push the eventual democratic nominee to embrace progressive ideals during the 2016 primaries . clinton , who lost her first presidential campaign to a challenger from the left , seems to recognize that the liberal wing of the party has grown even more vocal and influential since then , especially on economic matters . her video message on sunday centered on the theme of upward mobility and an economic recovery that has left some behind . `` americans have fought their way back from tough economic times , but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top , '' clinton said , vowing to be a `` champion '' of `` everyday americans . '' that statement tracks closely with her tone in recent public appearances , where the former secretary has been hitting on populist economic themes . she has taken on a range of issues that most appeal to liberals , such as the wealth gap , minimum wage and equal pay , in the months leading up to her announcement . in january , she took to social media to defend the 2010 dodd-frank wall street reform law , which contains provisions that the industry has tried to roll back . `` attacking financial reform is risky and wrong , '' she wrote on twitter . bill daley , a longtime clinton ally and former obama chief of staff , said clinton has to reintroduce herself to the party . if she defends policies viewed as having contributed to the financial crisis , daley said , `` that 's a problem . '' he continued : `` my guess is she 'll have enough policy positions that says she 's not in the tank with them . '' clinton 's early gestures have not satisfied some activists , who point to massachusetts democratic sen. elizabeth warren as their candidate of choice . several liberal groups have even launched a formal draft campaign to elevate the senator and highlight her progressive views . former republican new hampshire sen. judd gregg , who served as head of the securities industry and financial markets association , said part of clinton 's challenge stems from the fact that `` the center of the democratic party has moved very much to the left . '' `` hillary has always been much more rational on these issues and much more mainstream , '' gregg said . `` i presume she 's going to get the nomination , but she may be contested from the left . '' while warren has shown no interest in running for president this cycle , other democrats have been taking aim at big banks as they tour the early presidential states . former maryland gov. martin o'malley , former virginia sen. jim webb and vermont sen. bernie sanders , an independent who caucuses with democrats , are all testing the waters . they have made economic populism central to their potential campaigns , proposing to crack down on the banking sector , reform the culture on wall street and toughen financial regulations . none of these potential candidates will be able to compete with clinton 's extensive fundraising apparatus . but their presence in the race could exert pressure on clinton to embrace progressive policies . after clinton 's announcement sunday , a collection of liberal activists declared that the former secretary of state must prove her progressive bona fides . `` we look forward to hillary clinton and other candidates laying out their platforms and hearing whether they embrace the fights that sen. warren has spent her life leading , '' said ready for warren campaign manager erica sagrans . `` in the coming days , ready for warren will be stepping up our efforts to convince warren to run for president . '' now that she is a formally declared candidate , political strategists expect clinton to be more outspoken , laying out her economic priorities quickly and in her own terms . democratic strategist chris lehane downplayed the notion of clinton-warren tension in the democratic party , predicting that with clinton as an announced candidate , `` she 'll offer a pretty compelling rationale '' for her campaign . lehane , who worked in bill clinton 's administration , said he envisioned an economic message for clinton anchored in her biography : `` i grew up in the midwest in a middle class family , i understand the challenges that they face , we need to make sure that america gives people a fair shot . '' despite clinton 's embrace of more populist rhetoric , finance and business leaders are n't too concerned that she will back policies that are anathema to them . they expect that she will be able to articulate a broad economic goals aimed at the middle class rather than one that rails against bailouts and financial excess , particularly as the country gets more distance from the last financial crisis . kathy wylde , president of the partnership for new york city , a prominent business coalition , predicted that clinton would be able to maintain her relationship with wall street without alienating the liberal base . the fact that clinton `` is knowledgeable and maintains good , open relationships with the business and financial world does not suggest that she 's in anybody 's pocket , '' wylde said . `` she 's demonstrated that she 's an independent force .

      "b\"\\xc0S-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the stage of a tv studio in phnom penh , cambodian-american ly sivhong is telling an engrossed audience a tragic , but familiar , story . on april 17 , 1975 -- 40 years ago today -- life as ly knew it was shattered when her hometown , the cambodian capital of phnom penh , fell to the genocidal khmer rouge regime of the communist party of kampuchea . ly , then 13 , was separated from her mother and two of her sisters who , along with virtually the entire population of phnom penh -- about two million people -- were sent on a forced march into the countryside to work . ly never saw them again , nor learned what happened to them . but about 20,000 people died from execution , starvation or exhaustion during this exodus at gunpoint , according to war crimes prosecutors ; the others were subjected to slave labor in rural camps once they reached their destination , where many met similar fates . the urban evacuation marked the first phase in the khmer rouge 's revolutionary program of social engineering , intended to establish a new order -- free of money , family ties , religion , education , property and foreign influence . aimed at creating an agrarian utopia , it would instead prove one of the worst genocides of the modern era , resulting in the deaths of at least 1.7 million cambodians -- about a quarter of the country 's population -- over the next four years . ly remained in the capital with her father and four other siblings , three of whom would succumb to starvation and disease in the following years , before her father was shot to death before her eyes in 1979 . his killing prompted ly to leave her sole remaining family member , youngest sister bo , in the care of a local couple . she set out on her own , making her way to a refugee camp and eventually to the united states . for more than 30 years she has wondered what happened to her baby sister . `` i think she was the only family member to survive , '' she says , with tears in her eyes . as she finishes her story , the producers usher a woman on the stage . it 's bo . ly embraces her sister and both women sob . `` i missed you so much , '' ly says . `` i 've always searched for you , '' bo tells her . since production began five years ago , the television show , `` it 's not a dream , '' has reunited members of 54 cambodian families shattered by the genocide . more than 1,500 have sought its help . the series is just one example of the ways in which cambodia 's traumatized society is beginning to undertake the fraught , painful business of reckoning with their history . `` the scars of the khmer rouge are very deep and physical and present in modern cambodia , '' said theary seng , a human rights lawyer whose parents were killed by the regime , and who moved to the u.s. as a refugee before returning to her homeland as an adult . she described the country as a `` land of orphans . '' for decades after the khmer rouge were driven from phnom penh by soviet-backed vietnamese forces in january 1979 , the regime 's crimes were seldom spoken about , let alone attempts made to seek redress for victims . in large part , this was because people remained scared , say experts . far from being snuffed out by the vietnamese invasion , the khmer rouge existed for another two decades . after fleeing the capital in 1979 , khmer rouge leader pol pot and his supporters established a stronghold in the west . they continued as an insurgent guerrilla force and became part of a government-in-exile that , until 1990 , was recognized by the u.n. as the country 's only legitimate representative . `` in many villages , people have been living side by side with the executioners for decades , '' said krisna uk , executive director of the center for khmer studies . craig etcheson , a cambodia expert at the school for conflict analysis and resolution at george mason university , said that `` for many years , there was a virtual taboo on even speaking of the khmer rouge , as if the very words were ... a malevolent spirit lurking in the corner of every room . '' the silence was also due to the fact that cambodians , in seng 's words , `` lacked the vocabulary '' of therapy and healing to process a crime of the magnitude of the one perpetrated against their society . the khmer rouge 's attempts to reboot society at `` year zero '' had involved a concentrated effort to exterminate the country 's educated classes -- doctors , lawyers , accountants , engineers , merchants and clergy . `` nearly two generations of young cambodian men grew up learning little more than how to kill , '' said etcheson . `` when it was finally time to rebuild , there were effectively no bootstraps with which the country could pull itself up again . '' even today , said uk , young cambodians are not taught about the genocide in high school . in an impoverished country -- one of asia 's poorest , albeit with 7 % predicted economic growth this year -- most young people seemed to be focused on getting ahead than looking back , she said . some were even skeptical that the khmer rouge 's crimes -- the systematic butchery of the `` killing fields '' -- had really occurred , she added . the space for discussing , redressing and healing from the genocide only began to open up in the past decade with the establishment of the khmer rouge tribunal , said seng . founded in 2006 , the extraordinary chambers in the courts of cambodia -lrb- eccc -rrb- is a `` hybrid '' tribunal using both cambodian and international judges and staff to investigate the khmer rouge 's crimes against humanity and bring leading regime figures to justice . intended as a southeast asian equivalent of the nuremberg trials , the tribunal , which has cost $ 232 million so far , initially enjoyed broad support . `` we had great hope for this process , '' said seng . `` the presence of the international community raised the comfort level of the population to speak about the khmer rouge crimes . '' but the pace of proceedings has seemed glacial , given the advancing years of the suspected war criminals , two of whom have died while facing trial . another was ruled mentally unfit to stand trial . -lrb- the khmer rouge 's top leader , pol pot , died in 1998 , having never faced charges . -rrb- . this , coupled with persistent accusations of political interference from the cambodian government , has soured attitudes towards the court . seng , who once appeared as a civil party in proceedings , today regards it as a `` sham . '' for many victims , it is `` too little , too late . '' opinion : an ongoing struggle for justice after the khmer rouge . in the first case heard , kaing guek eav , also known as comrade duch -- commandant of the notorious tuol sleng prison where more than 14,000 people were killed -- received a life sentence for war crimes , crimes against humanity , murder and torture . the court 's only other verdicts , delivered in august last year , sentenced non chea , the regime 's `` brother number two , '' and khieu samphan , `` brother number four , '' to life . both men have appealed their convictions . in a separate case , the pair are on trial on additional charges of crimes against humanity and genocide . evidence is expected to continue being heard into 2016 , eccc spokesman lars olsen said . two further , and highly controversial cases , known as 003 and 004 , are also currently under investigation . three people were charged last month in relation to those cases : former khmer rouge navy commander meas muth ; im chaem , a former district commander accused of leading a labor camp ; and ao an , a former deputy accused of overseeing massacres at detention centers . two other suspects are being investigated . olsen said no further cases would be pursued after 003 and 004 . prime minister hun sen , cambodia 's strongman leader for decades , has long been a vocal opponent of 003 and 004 , claiming that pursuing the cases could push the country towards civil war . hun sen himself is a former khmer rouge battalion commander , who defected to the vietnamese side ; his perceived political interference is viewed by critics like seng as an attempt to shield political allies from the tribunal . others are more forgiving of the tribunal 's shortcomings . etcheson , a former investigator for the tribunal , has described it as an `` imperfect vessel '' for delivering justice , but says cambodia 's leaders must strike a balance between two imperatives : delivering justice for victims , and completing the reintegration of former khmer rouge into society . he said the most important aspects of the tribunal 's work are those that take place outside the courtroom -- triggering changes in cambodian society . `` in that respect , the proceedings ... may be shaping up to be more successful than anyone could have hoped , '' he added . undoubtedly , cambodians today have overcome the fear of talking about the genocide -- to the extent that even the perpetrators feel emboldened to say their piece . krisna uk said the country has seen a wave of khmer rouge memoirs , written by former cadres wanting to argue their case before they die . `` there 's a lot of people who want to tell the world they 've been fooled by a grand idea of a revolution which went bad , '' she said . khieu samphan , `` brother number four , '' published one such effort ahead of his trial , while sikoeun suong , a sorbonne-educated former diplomat for the khmer rouge regime , published his `` journey of a khmer rouge intellectual '' in french in 2013 . he told an interviewer from france 's le monde last year that he believed that khmer rouge dictator pol pot 's prescriptions for cambodia were sound . `` i remain convinced that the marxist analysis made by pol pot of the socioeconomic situation of cambodia , a poor and sparsely populated country , was correct , '' he said . for survivors , these self-serving justifications for crimes gone unpunished must be hard to take . but for a few of them , at least , cambodia 's opening up about the genocide has finally brought about the prospect of some healing , however bittersweet . on the stage of the `` it 's not a dream '' studio , as ly hugs her long-lost sister , footage of an even older woman is projected on a screen . `` do you know the person in the video ?

      "b\"\\xe2O-lrb- cnn -rrb- they come from more than 20 countries , drawn to libya as the funnel to europe . eritreans want to escape repression or military service ; somalis flee al-shabaab and clan warfare ; syrians have given up hope of returning home . in villages in senegal and elsewhere across west africa , young men sell all they have in the hope of a better life in europe , perhaps hoping to join a cousin or brother who made it . motivations among the tens of thousands making the trek to the mediterranean coast are as many and varied as the nationalities involved , according to researchers and human rights groups . but in 2014 more than 80 % of them headed for the libyan coast as the easiest point of embarkation . from the horn of africa to the atlantic , from syria and gaza , these would-be migrants travel well-established smuggling routes . along the way they must cross deserts and mountains , risk kidnap or robbery , are often cheated or left stranded . one african migrant reported surviving on toothpaste for days . a teenage somali who made it to malta told researchers that he had warned other family members not to come . `` i tell them its 95 % sure that you will die , '' he said . the international organization for migration -lrb- iom -rrb- has tracked the migrant flows through north africa for years . eritreans have long been prominent among the travelers , escaping an authoritarian government , poverty and indefinite military service -- a land without possibilities . `` many conscripts are not demobilized from the military as scheduled and some were forced to serve indefinitely under threats of detention , torture , or punishment of their families , '' according to a report by the regional mixed migration secretariat -lrb- rmms -rrb- in nairobi last year . they travel to sudan , so long as they can avoid kidnap by tribes on the border , and are handed from one group of smugglers to the next in relay . one eritrean woman told the un refugee agency -lrb- unhcr -rrb- this month that she had paid $ 5,000 to reach the mediterranean . eritreans and syrians made up half of the migrant traffic to europe last year , according to arezo malakooti , director of migration research at altai consulting and author of one of the most detailed studies of migration patterns . malakooti has recently visited seven countries , including libya , tunisia and morocco to update her study . the `` push factor '' is much greater than the `` pull '' of europe , she says . upheavals and instability across much of africa and the middle east -- combined with the perception that libya 's doors are open -- have led to a massive increase in the numbers trying to reach libya . `` worsening repression in eritrea '' has been one factor , she says -- while eritreans already in refugee camps in sudan have decided to make a dash for the mediterranean . one reason is that other routes -- through saudi arabia and to israel -- have become more difficult : israel has adopted a much tougher approach on would-be eritrean migrants trying to enter the country through the sinai desert , including detention , and yemen 's implosion has cut off that conduit . as one eritrean told the humanitarian journal irin last year : `` people were traveling to israel because it was the only way , and now they 're traveling to europe because it 's the only way . '' somalis , often seen as the third most numerous nationality among migrants headed to the mediterranean , face a perfect storm of crises . `` extreme poverty ; prolonged insecurity ; sexual violence and other serious human rights violations ; lack of access to basic needs such as food , medical services , healthcare and livelihoods '' are all contributory factors , says the rmms . sea-tossed storm of human misery hits italian shores . the iom told cnn it is seeing a spike in would-be migrants from senegal , mali , guinea and gambia in west africa . many reason that libya 's chaos is an opportunity : border posts are left abandoned , the coastline unguarded . most west africans make the journey for economic reasons ; the majority are single men in their twenties . populations in the region are swelling but farmland and economic security shrinking . often , say researchers , the oldest son leaves to find work so he can remit funds home -- perhaps misled by fables of riches . malakooti noted in a recent report that `` unrealistic expectations of their migration is fueled by migrants in destination who rarely send negative news home because of the pressure on them to succeed . '' but west africans who have sold livestock or other possessions only to be caught or stranded can face destitution when they return home : 400 senegalese were recently repatriated from libya by the red cross and iom . malians have the added incentive of the recent conflict in which jihadist groups seized nearly half the country before french-led intervention pushed them back . joel millman of the iom says there 's also been an increase in the number of nigerian christians following this route , escaping the chaos and brutality inflicted on their towns and villages by boko haram . another disturbing phenomenon , according to malakooti , is the trafficking of african women for prostitution to italy through libya . while still a small fraction of the overall migration , the number of women smuggled for sexual exploitation in europe rose threefold in 2014 , she says . why migrants are risking their lives to reach italy . a geneva-based group , the global initiative against transnational organized crime , estimated last year that about half of west african migrants pass through the town of agadez in northern niger . a crackdown in 2013 on organized convoys leaving agadez stemmed the flow for a while , but gangs from the toubou tribe , which controls the cross-border trade , developed new routes and raised their prices . a migrant might pay as much as $ 300 to reach southern libya in a truck or pick-up , according to researchers . reliable figures on the numbers passing through agadez are difficult to come by , but the consensus among experts is somewhere between 2,000 and 7,000 every month . other hubs include khartoum in sudan , a way-station for migrants from east africa , and tamanrasset in southern algeria , where a fake malian passport aids passage . algeria has also been a destination for syrian refugees , but new visa requirements have forced them to seek other routes -- often through turkey and the greek islands . hundreds of thousands of other migrants have already been in libya for years , attracted to jobs as day laborers when moammar gadhafi was in power . now they face violence , discrimination and religious persecution -- and are unable even to remit home what little they earn . so at least some are embarking on a journey to europe they never intended to take . malakooti believes this is a major factor in the rising numbers trying to reach europe . the recent murder of egyptian and ethiopian christians by isis 's libyan affiliate may have hastened the departure of some . a similar dynamic applies to syrian refugees . `` initially , they remained in lebanon , jordan and other neighboring countries to wait out the conflict , '' says malakooti . now they 've given up , or the resources to accommodate them have evaporated -- and have decided to try to reach europe and start over . within libya , the smugglers for the most part appear to be small groups or individuals rather than large networks , according to human rights organizations . they cluster in dusty towns such as sabha and qatrun and use what are known as ` connection houses . ' how is europe going to tackle migrant crisis . those driving migrants to tripoli may have no connection with gangs at the coast . such a journey , across the desert to avoid checkpoints , might cost a migrant $ 200 : in a failed state that sort of cash quickly generates armed rivalries . tribal feuds , roaming militias and criminal gangs mean migrants need the skills of a smuggler . the arrival of the islamic state in iraq and syria -lrb- isis -rrb- in libya has further complicated passage ; in january jihadists killed 14 libyan soldiers near sabha . malakooti detects a changing pattern since the syrian conflict began . it has injected more money into the smuggling business , which has therefore become more organized . the more reliable groups can charge more ; she says some migrants buy a `` package '' from smugglers that includes overland and sea travel . syrian migrants are relatively better off than west africans , and may pay more to guarantee a place on the top deck of a vessel . africans are more often locked in the hold and are more vulnerable if a vessel sinks , or consigned to an inflatable dinghy . fearing arrest , the smugglers rarely travel on the boats themselves , instead giving a compass or gps device to the migrants , who then set off with no navigational skills and often no experience of the sea in boats that should never have left port . as libya becomes more dangerous for migrants , other countries on both sides of the mediterranean are looking on anxiously . some west africans opt to travel through morocco -- even though the chances of detection there are much greater and the sea crossing to spain very difficult . `` a migrant might need 50 or 60 attempts before making it to the spanish coast , '' says malakooti . tunisia has massively increased security along its eastern border with libya ; both algeria and morocco have begun building fences along their border -- against both terrorism and clandestine migration . but they may be little deterrent . the eritrean writer abu bakr khaal made the desperate voyage to and across the mediterranean himself . in his novel `` african titanics , '' he describes the `` dangerous lure '' of escape . only too late do the migrants discover a grim reality at sea : . '' ` if god loved me he would not have brought me here , ' groaned one of the passengers . assured he had uttered the most fitting farewell to life , he threw himself into the sea . the boat moved forward at the whim of the waves .

      "b\"\\xaa&-lrb- cnn -rrb- a 24-year-old man is in custody after he called for an ambulance , only to have french authorities come and discover weapons , ammunition and evidence of his plans to target churches -- an attack that someone in syria requested , a top prosecutor said wednesday . the man was identified later as sid ahmed ghlam , french interior minister bernard cazeneuve told television broadcaster tf1 . paris prosecutor francois molins said ghlam asked for medical help at his home in paris ' 13th district sunday morning , claiming he had accidentally injured himself when he mishandled a weapon . but authorities found more than a man with a gunshot wound in his thigh . molins said ghlam was someone suspected of killing a 32-year-old woman hours earlier and who then intended to launch a larger-scale terror attack in the near future . '' -lrb- he -rrb- let them believe that he was the victim , '' french president francois hollande said wednesday . `` but police understood that there was an investigation that needed to be initiated . '' that probe started in earnest when police spotted traces of blood and bags in the suspect 's car . based on this discovery `` and in view of the attitude and suspicious behavior of the individual , '' they looked inside the car and found a loaded kalashnikov gun , a 9-mm revolver , three cell phones , a laptop , a usb key , a satellite navigation system `` and handwritten documents that contained information on possible targets , '' molins said . a search inside his home turned up yet more potentially key evidence , including three more kalashnikovs , three bulletproof vests , police armbands , a camera , some 2,000 euros in cash and `` documents in arabic mentioning al qaeda and isis , '' according to the prosecutor . `` a terrorist attack has been foiled , '' hollande said . `` it 's not the first time . '' earlier ghlam was identified as a computer science student originally from algeria . according to molins , he lived in that north african country until 2001 , joined his parents in france for the next two years , then went back to algeria . he got his undergraduate degree in that nation , then returned to france to study electronics . he 'd never been convicted of a crime ; in fact , the lone accusation against him in august 2013 was later withdrawn . but that did n't mean french authorities did n't know about ghlam . `` he had been noticed wishing to go to syria , '' molins explained . the prosecutor added that authorities found nothing to suggest he was imminent threat , `` but he was under surveillance . '' law enforcement checked on the man once in 2014 and again this year , cazeneuve said . the minister said the man planned to head to syria , a country embroiled in a bloody , years-long civil war that has attracted foreigners wishing to join extremist militant groups like isis . there was no indication he ever made it . but , molins said , computer searches revealed that the man had been communicating with someone in syria who `` asked him to target a church . '' what church ? authorities did n't disclose that detail on wednesday , though molins did say `` this target was confirmed by -lrb- the suspect 's satellite navigation system -rrb- and handwritten documents in his car . '' paris is home to the famed notre dame cathedral and sacre coeur basilica , both huge draws for tourists . it 's not known if either were in line to be attacked , but prime minister manuel valls wednesday visited one of the churches allegedly targeted , which was located in the paris suburb of villejuif . assuming ghlam does n't walk free anytime soon -- for now , he 's in custody awaiting possible charges -- that attack wo n't happen anytime soon . but authorities say he 's already claimed at least one victim . her name is aurelie chatelain . the 32-year-old was found dead sunday morning sitting in the passenger seat of a parked car in villejuif , killed by a single bullet that struck her shoulder , went through her body and ended up embedded in the seat . cazeneuve said chatelain was the mother of a 5-year-old girl and had come to the region on saturday to attend a training class . it 's not known what connection , if any , she had with the suspect . nonetheless , molins said that ballistics , dna , satellite navigation and other evidence connected him to the death of chatelain , who molins called the region 's first victim of terrorism since january . that 's when the massacre at charlie hebdo 's offices and the siege of a kosher market in paris took place , prompting french authorities to beef up security measures . `` france , like other countries , is facing a terror threat that is unprecedented in its nature and magnitude , '' valls said .

      "b\"\\xfc\\x17-lrb- cnn -rrb- a saudi-led coalition tuesday ended its `` operation decisive storm '' -- its nearly monthlong airstrike campaign in yemen -- and a new initiative is underway . `` operation renewal of hope '' will focus on the political process . saudi arabia had launched airstrikes on houthi positions across yemen , hoping to wipe out the iranian-allied rebel group that has overthrown the government and seized power . the saudis say they want to restore the yemeni government , a key u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda , which was kicked out of the capital by the rebels earlier this year . this month , saudi officials said airstrikes have degraded houthi-controlled military infrastructure , including key buildings in the capital sanaa . the campaign achieved its objectives `` by a very good planning , very precise execution , by the courage of our pilots , our sailors , our soldiers , '' said brig. gen. ahmed asiri , a saudi military spokesman . a senior saudi official told cnn that the houthis agreed to `` nearly all demands '' of the u.n. security council . former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh and his family will leave yemen and never return for a position in politics , the source said . a statement from the saudi embassy in washington outlined objectives of the next phase of operations , including protecting civilians , enhancing humanitarian and medical assistance , confronting terrorism and creating an international coalition to provide maritime security . ground troops will continue to protect the border and confront any attempts to destabilize the situation , asiri said . military action will be taken if needed . but beyond the military campaign , the saudis and their allies have said they want to find a political solution for the violence-plagued nation . the aim is to bring back yemen 's `` security and stability through establishing a political process , '' said a statement from saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , bahrain , qatar and kuwait . ousted yemen president abdu rabu mansour hadi thanked the saudi-led coalition . hadi claims he 's yemen 's legitimate leader and is working with the saudis and other allies to return to his country . `` we promise to restructure the yemen military to ensure that it serves the people of yemen , '' hadi said , calling on the houthis to withdraw , and saying that he would return to yemen at `` the right time '' to rebuild the country . `` you will witness many changes in the days to come in our mission to build an institutional government and military , far from rebel militancy , '' said hadi . also tuesday , a u.s. military official told cnn that the united states is conducting `` manned reconnaissance '' off yemen . the official stressed that the repositioning of u.s. ships over the last days was not done to interdict iranian ships , but to ensure freedom of navigation and maritime security . why is saudi arabia bombing yemen ? cnn 's jethro mullen , tim lister , anas hamdan , jamie crawford and journalist hakim almasmari contributed to this report .j\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' in 2007 , he appeared on another al qaeda video in which he warned america to end its involvement in the affairs of predominantly muslim countries . `` your failure to heed our demands ... means that you and your people will ... experience things which will make you forget about the horrors of september 11 , afghanistan and iraq and virginia tech , '' he said , the last reference being to the mass shooting at the virginia university in 2007 . in separate videos over the years , he criticized president george w. bush and president barack obama , whom he called `` a devious , evasive and serpentine american president with a muslim name . '' he also addressed his jewish ancestry and tore up his u.s. passport on camera . gadahn appeared in videos commemorating the 9/11 attacks , some which included al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri . he urged muslims in the united states to stage their own lone-wolf attacks . `` america is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms , '' he said . `` you can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle without a background check and most likely without having to show an identification card . so what are you waiting for ? '' in other videos , he called nidal hasan , the army officer sentenced to death in the 2009 shootings at fort hood , texas , `` the ideal role model for every repentant muslim in the armies of the unbelievers and apostate regimes , '' and praised the 2012 killing of u.s. ambassador chris stevens in benghazi , libya . his final video was posted online in september 2014 by al qaeda media wing al sahab . he called for muslims to work to overthrow governments in saudi arabia and pakistan . cruickshank said gadahn had begun to play an increasingly prominent institutional role inside al qaeda . among the documents recovered from osama bin laden 's compound in abbottabad after bin laden 's death was a 2011 letter from gadahn making recommendations for al qaeda 's media strategy . gadahn was married to a muslim woman from afghanistan and reportedly had at least one child . cnn 's steve almasy contributed to this report .\\x01\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb8#seoul , south korea -lrb- cnn -rrb- on march 20 , 2013 , a cyberattack brought chaos to several banks and media outlets in south korea . then more ominously on december 23 last year , computers at the country 's nuclear operator were breached . again cybercrime was suspected . the source of these attacks ? north korea . and south korean investigators say they have proof -- the actual malicious codes used in the attacks . they shared this data with cnn . the 2013 attack , known as `` dark seoul , '' paralyzed an estimated 48,000 computers at a number of major banks and broadcasters , disrupting network systems and wiping their hard disks clean . `` it would try to delete essentially all your files ... then restart the system . you would come back up and nothing would be there , '' joshua james , a digital forensic expert , told cnn . `` if it infected more financial systems , it could have deleted all financial data in korea . i mean , it is dangerous , '' the visiting professor at chuncheon 's hallym university added . live footage of the breaches showed computer screens at the media companies completely down , while bank customers were unable to make withdrawals , or transfer money online . `` dark seoul '' happened shortly after the north korean government announced it would end the armistice agreement that brought the three-year korean war to an end in july 1953 amid growing tensions with its neighbor . the latest high-profile digital incursion , in december , attempted to steal data from south korea 's nuclear operator , including plant blueprints and personnel information . though investigators said no critical data was stolen , the attack raised serious concerns about the safety and security of the 23 nuclear power plants it runs . the attack itself was described by james as a `` spear-fishing '' exercise where unsuspecting victims -- retired and current employees of the nuclear operator -- were prompted to open up a disguised document in their email . `` as soon as you double click on it , it starts running in the background of your computer where you ca n't see ... it 's also trying to open up your computer -- what we call a back door -- to give access to the infected system by the attacker , '' he told cnn . the attack , which james said was simpler than `` dark seoul , '' came just a few days after sony pictures said their systems has been `` hacked , '' another attack the south korean authorities blamed on north korea . `` from a law enforcement or investigation side , we 're trying to actually trace back to who did it , '' said james . seoul announced in mid-march that some of the ip addresses used in december incursion could be traced back to shenyang , china , which can be easily accessed from the north korean border . codes used in the attack were said to be similar in pattern to those used by the north koreans , south korean authorities said . `` the malicious codes used in the attack were same in composition and working methods as `` kimsuky '' codes known to be used by north korea , '' the prosecutor 's office that leads 17 other government agencies and internet companies in the investigation said in the statement in march . pyongyang has dismissed the claims it launched these attacks , calling them a `` plot and fabrication that can never win over the truth . '' but many experts say north korea appears to be investing more in cyberwarfare because it is cheaper than spending on conventional weapons and can cause significant economic damage to its southern rival . indeed south korea 's defense ministry estimates that north korea is operating a `` cyberarmy '' of 6,000 workers as it focuses on strengthening its asymmetrical warfare capability . `` hacks are going on all the time , constantly -- though how many actually make the news is a very small amount , '' said james . `` how many are detected in general ? i think the average person would have no clue they 've been hacked . `` organizations need to invest the same amount that hackers are investing to protect themselves and right now they 're not , '' he added . many in south korea believe not enough effort is being put into defending against cyberattacks . a report by the korea institute for industrial economics and trade , a government-funded think tank , estimates that `` dark seoul '' caused about $ 820 million worth of damage . its report , published in 2014 , predicted that by 2020 , south korea could be exposed to hacking attacks causing up to $ 25 billion in economic damage .\\\\\\x1c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd06-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's only a few weeks since the first presidential announcement but already it feels like the campaign is in high gear . a number of politicians have officially announced their candidacies and the outline of their messages is starting to emerge . hillary clinton , who announced last week , even jumped into her black van for a road trip out to iowa , including a pit stop at chipotle along the way . although the campaign has barely begun , most of the candidates -- and some probable candidates -- are already starting to make mistakes . most of the mistakes will simply be blips along the way , but some of them might end up being more damaging if they feed into negative perceptions that voters have about the candidates . here are a few notable mistakes in the past few weeks : . trying to separate himself from the pack , new jersey gov. chris christie called for substantial cuts to social security . he also promised to reverse the marijuana legalization laws that many states have been enacting in response to ballot initiatives . both of these statements could come back to bite him , should he run for president . while christie sees social security cuts as a way to `` go big '' in crafting a platform for a possible presidential run , as many republicans have discovered social security is a very popular program and one that has strong support from americans who are over 60 -- a big part of the electorate . on marijuana legalization , christie inserted himself into an issue that has growing public support in red and blue states , especially with the younger and independent voters who christie is promising to bring into a potential campaign . if christie continues to veer right it will be harder to sell himself as the moderate in the race , and yet there is little chance that he will secure conservative votes over someone like sen. ted cruz . sen. cruz impressed many observers when he announced his candidacy at liberty university . but soon after he did something that took many people by surprise . the texas senator , who has been one of the leading opponents of president barack obama 's health care plan , acknowledged that he would be enrolling in the affordable care act program since his wife was taking a leave of absence from her job to help with the campaign . it will be hard for him to live this one down . since he wants to sell himself as the authentic conservative and the republican who will give democrats their biggest toughest fight , the fact that he decided to join a program he has railed against -- and tied up congress with -- will raise questions about whether he is just another politician , and not a true zealot over obamacare . the decision will offer plenty of fodder to democrats who want to remind voters that republicans rail against government even when they and their constituents depend on it . if anyone faces authenticity questions , it is kentucky sen. rand paul . as the so-called `` libertarian '' in the campaign , paul is aiming to attract younger republicans who otherwise are not interested in the party . he is also hoping to bring back hard-core anti-government conservatives who believed that their party has moved too far away from their original goals . paul has already struggled to justify some of his recent announcements , such as calling for a more aggressive war against isis and his statements against gay marriage . but after announcing his presidency , he brought himself more trouble with his aggressive interaction with `` today '' host savannah guthrie . paul became clearly aggravated with what the host and went so far as go explain how to conduct the interview . the interview focused most media attention on paul 's temper and his interactions with women rather than his message . in an interview on cnbc , he put his finger to his lips and said `` shhh , calm down '' to anchor kelly evans . both moments revealed a side of his character than until that moment had been somewhat off the radar . `` you 're coming off as pretty thin-skinned in your interviews , '' megyn kelly of fox news told the senator . thus far , clinton has had a fairly smooth opening but during her first week on the trail , she did make a minor mistake . while speaking in norwalk , iowa , clinton said during a discussion about immigration reform that `` all my grandparents , you know , came over here '' even though only one was really an immigrant . her staff corrected the statements . `` her grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and , as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants . as has been correctly pointed out , while her grandfather was an immigrant , it appears that hillary 's grandmother was born shortly after her parents and siblings arrived in the u.s. in the early 1880s . '' clinton 's campaign video seemed pitch perfect to many observers , as she largely removed herself from the story line . her drive to iowa demonstrated that she is n't likely to repeat the kinds of mistakes that she made in 2008 when she failed to take the nuts and bolts of caucus organization seriously . although the entire opening certainly had the flavor of a made for television event , it has generally been well-received . clearly the biggest `` gaffe '' in the run-up to the clinton campaign was in how she handled the story of her use of a private server rather than the state department email system . although she dragged out the campaign announcement , she certainly should have had more of the team in place given how much attention she would receive . at first she stumbled in her response , giving the accusers time to spin the story as reflecting a tendency to hide information and suggesting that she was still the untruthful person so many people suspected . rubio announced his presidential run after the biggest announcement of them all : hillary clinton . given that rubio is not one of the most well-known of the candidates , outside of republican political circles , his timing was not perfect . the announcement was overshadowed by clinton 's video and drive to iowa . coming on the heels of obama 's historic discussions with cuba , the timing and sequence did n't help the senator to get the kind of initial buzz that he was hoping for . although in the long run this wo n't make a difference , it might have been wise for him to delay the announcement and give his campaign some breathing space . all of these are still relatively small missteps in the very start of the campaign . and we know from social scientists than individual gaffes and mistakes do n't really have a big impact on the outcome of these contests , so much as the `` fundamentals '' like the ability to raise campaign contributions and the endorsements from political elites . still , mistakes can play a role in campaigns . while individual mistakes might be fleeting , collectively , these kinds of moments can shape how voters think of candidates when the time comes for a vote .\\x15\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfe6boston -lrb- cnn -rrb- when the bomb went off , steve woolfenden thought he was still standing . that was because , as he lay on the ground , he was still holding the handles of his son 's stroller . he pulled back the stroller 's cover and saw that his son , leo , 3 , was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head . woolfenden checked leo for other injuries and thought , `` let 's get out of here . '' that was before he noticed his achilles tendon , which resembled transparent tape covered in blood , and his left tibia protruding from his boot . the boot was next to his left stump , he testified before a federal jury thursday , the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the boston marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for dzhokhar tsarnaev . the prosecution rested thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless . the defense , led by famed death penalty opponent judy clarke , is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing . clarke will begin those efforts monday . a group of tsarnaev 's relatives arrived at boston 's logan international airport on thursday , cnn affiliate whdh reported , but it 's not clear if they plan to testify . the jury must decide whether the 21-year-old , who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother , will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison . woolfenden , a biomedical researcher for the novartis institutes , recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort leo . the boy cried , `` mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! mommy ! daddy ! '' he testified . amid the stench of `` burning hair , blood , sulfur , '' a good samaritan emerged . he gave woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed leo to safety . `` i was completely terrified because i did n't know if i was ever going to see my son again . there was blood all over the sidewalk , all around me , '' he said . dr. david king , a trauma surgeon at massachusetts general hospital , spent 14 years in the u.s. army as a combat surgeon and served in iraq and afghanistan , as well as in haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake . he has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices , he testified , and what he saw in boston that day was n't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones . `` i arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up , '' he said . `` i looked across the patients and i knew immediately , without anyone having to tell me , exactly what the wounding mechanism was . '' heather abbott had no such experience , so when one of the two bombs exploded , sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a `` puddle of chaos and blood and glass , '' her instinct was to run . but she could n't . her foot felt like it was on fire , she testified . two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a hail mary . she called for her husband . he picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant . `` i saw blood pouring out of my foot , '' she said . she finally got to a hospital , and after three attempts to save her foot , which was missing its entire heel , a doctor told her she had a decision : she could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee . she chose the latter . `` it was probably the hardest decision i 've had to make , '' she testified . another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the tsarnaev brothers ' attack , marc fucarile , recounted the two bombs going off . `` i stepped back , and the next thing i remember was looking up at the sky , '' he testified , adding that he remembered `` a lot of yelling , a lot of screaming , people crying out for tourniquets . '' a nurse was sitting on his chest , and someone said , `` oh , s *** , he 's on fire ! '' he tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot . a firefighter would later tell fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter . he does n't remember that . in addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body , doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit . he still gets blisters . `` so where the prosthetic attaches on your butt , it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds , '' he said . and though his left leg survived , it was severely burned , his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered , he said . he hopes to save the left leg , he testified , but it 's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee . he takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning , 22 in afternoon , 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries , he said . one of the most dramatic points in thursday 's testimony involved the death of young martin richard . the prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old , who was only 3 1/2 feet from one of the bombs , according to the fbi 's re-creation of the crime scene . his parents , bill and denise , are opposed to tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase , though bill richard did testify during the guilt phase . dr. king told the court that martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground , meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso . it 's highly unlikely the boy died instantly , king said . explaining that martin died of rapid blood loss , king testified , `` receptors are generally not responsive to cutting . if you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver , it generally does not hurt . what hurts is the stretching and twisting . ... intestines were pulled and twisted ; that would have caused visceral type pain . '' woolfenden , the biomedical researcher , recalled seeing martin and his mother shortly after the good samaritan took woolfenden 's son , leo , to safety . `` i saw martin 's face , and i could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured , '' he said , . martin 's hair was singed , his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape . as for martin 's torso , `` i saw an immense amount of blood . i was really , really terrified , '' woolfenden said . he recalled denise richard pleading with her son , saying , `` please '' and `` martin '' over and over . woolfenden placed his hand on denise richard 's back , he said . she turned to ask woolfenden if he was ok . he said he was , and she turned her attention back to martin . but no response came . according to testimony , martin 's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast . he bled to death on the sidewalk , and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs . cnn 's patrick cornell contributed to this report .\\xdb\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x92$-lrb- cnn -rrb- the world 's seventh-largest economy is heading toward collapse . an economic powerhouse conservatively valued at $ 24 trillion , one that annually churns out the equivalent of $ 2.5 trillion , is under assault . however , i am not referring to one of the g8 economies , but to the `` super economy '' of the ocean . it 's one that for far too long has been ignored and taken for granted -- and it is going downhill fast . the health and wealth of the ocean are assessed in a wwf report released thursday , reviving the ocean economy . the report is the result of a hard economic analysis performed by the boston consulting group built on a foundation of the latest ocean science provided by the global change institute of the university of queensland . true , the enormity of the ocean can complicate any single appraisal . but it is still important to try to understand its value if global leaders are ever going to sustain it for future generations . the fact is that the ocean feeds us , employs us , offers protection and plays a direct role in the lives and livelihoods of people throughout the world . the ocean also provides intangible but essential services to humanity , such as climate regulation and oxygen production , that are difficult to put in monetary terms . and while we all may look at the ocean from different perspectives , no one can escape the fact that it is a shared resource that provides for each and every one of us . a figure that may get lost in the headlines generated by our report is perhaps most telling : seventy percent of the ocean 's overall economic value relies on its continued health . ocean assets like fisheries , coral reefs , mangroves and seagrasses that produce goods and services rivaling the world 's top 10 economies will lose their value if we continue to over-exploit and outright destroy them . that may seem like a far-off possibility to some , but it is a future foretold by the many details in this report . for example , 90 percent of the world 's fish stocks are either fully exploited or over-exploited . and that is not all . by 2050 -- only a few decades from now -- it is possible that the ocean could lose its coral reefs , which have already been halved in the last few decades . this is n't just a concern for dive enthusiasts , but to the hundreds of millions of people that rely on ocean resources for their daily meals and their weekly paychecks . the ocean is truly too big to fail . the loss of the ocean 's critical habitats and species would have a devastating ripple effect on global food security and economies that no government bailout could salvage . fortunately , our report identifies actions that would revive the ocean economy , three of which are critical this year . first , the international community must rally around a set of sustainable development goals that clearly reflect the link between the environment -- including the ocean -- and human well-being . also , negotiators meeting in paris later this year must agree on an ambitious global climate deal that sets us on the path to avert the worst impacts of climate change . and finally , leaders must commit to conserving increasing amounts of coastal and marine areas over the course of the next 15 years . the economic case for why the ocean is so critical to livelihoods around the world is clear , and we will not be able to plead ignorance if we collectively preside over the collapse of the ocean economy . reviving the ocean economy is dedicated to helping us avoid that outcome , but it will require political vision and courage among policymakers . all this said , and as terrifying as it is that the deterioration of the ocean 's health has been its fastest in millions of years , there is actually some -lrb- potential -rrb- good news : if we act swiftly and with determination , marine resources can recover -- and recover quickly . many local examples -- from the mediterranean to the mozambique channel , from the fiji archipelago to the arctic -- show us that conservation , restoration and sustainable-use approaches mean the ocean , and the people who depend on it , can both prosper . ultimately , the ocean bridges continents , connects cultures and offers equal opportunity inspiration and we should therefore work together in support of this vital shared resource . but if we are to have any chance of avoiding the point of no return , we must find ways of reaching genuine global commitments on sustainable development and climate . after all , it 's far better to avoid an economic collapse than be forced to scramble to pick up the pieces .\\xc0\\x1e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x88;-lrb- cnn -rrb- relations between iran and saudi arabia have always been thorny , but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today . tehran and riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the middle east . in its most recent incarnation , the iranian-saudi conflict by proxy has reached yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic . for riyadh and its regional allies , the saudi military intervention in yemen -- `` operation decisive storm '' -- is the moment the sunni arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of shia-iranian influence . for tehran and its regional allies -- including the houthi movement in yemen -- saudi arabia 's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable . and yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war . when iranian president hassan rouhani was elected in june 2013 , he pledged to reach out to riyadh . he was up front and called tehran 's steep deterioration of relations with the saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on iranian foreign policy . from lebanon and afghanistan to pakistan and the gaza strip , the iranian-saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly . and yet despite rouhani 's open pledge , profound differences over syria and iraq in particular have kept riyadh and tehran apart . but if the questions of syria and iraq prevented a pause in hostilities , the saudi military intervention in yemen since late march has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels . unlike in syria and in iraq , the saudi military is now directly battling it out with iranian-backed rebels in yemen . while riyadh no doubt exaggerates tehran 's role in the yemen crisis , its fingerprints are nonetheless evident . `` iran provides financial support , weapons , training and intelligence to houthis , '' gerald feierstein , a u.s. state department official and former yemen ambassador , told a congressional hearing last week . `` we believe that iran sees opportunities with the houthis to expand its influence in yemen and threaten saudi and gulf arab interests . '' the iranians find the charges biased and point to the saudi airstrikes in yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor 's affairs . in iran , the cue came from the country 's top authority , supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , who has been unusually blunt . he tweeted : `` despite disputes , the saudis used to display composure -lsb- with -rsb- us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure -lsb- with -rsb- barbarism . '' three days after khamenei 's speech , iran suspended religious pilgrimages to mecca . this came as news broke about two iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting saudi arabia . meanwhile , anti-saudi protests have been staged in a number of iranian cities . khamenei 's speech opened the floodgate of anti-saudi statements . the voices of hardline figures in tehran have been the most agitated . general ahmad purdastan , the commander of the iranian ground forces , taunted the saudis . `` beware of the day when firecrackers explode in riyadh , '' purdastan said , in a not-so-subtle warning . but it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the saudis . ayatollah ali-akbar hashemi rafsanjani , a former president and arguably iran 's most vocal advocate of better iranian-saudi relations . called riyadh 's military intervention a `` strategic mistake '' and urged for a political solution . seeking a political solution is iran 's stated aim for the yemeni crisis , but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim . iranian foreign minister javad zarif has provided a four-point plan : to get a ceasefire , to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid , to promote political dialogue among warring yemeni parties , and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government . but the iranian proposal also asks for an end to saudi airstrikes . as zarif put it , `` iran and saudi arabia need to talk , but we can not talk to determine the future of yemen . '' the saudis have thus far ignored the iranian proposal . meanwhile , the houthi leadership has welcomed the plan . as one of its leaders said , `` in iran 's plan , unacceptable solutions do not exist . '' not only do the saudis not have any faith in any iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the houthis , but riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it . saudi arabia was elated by the u.n. security council vote on 14 april that condemned the houthi movement . only russia abstained . but a solution to the yemeni crisis will not come from the u.n. . the u.n. can provide a cover for riyadh 's military intervention , but it can not secure it a military win . this leaves riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in yemen . saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the houthi movement and it allies in the yemeni armed forces . it requires ground troops on a huge scale . riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco . the pakistanis most famously turned down the saudi request and let it be known that yemen is a quagmire they can do without . instead , islamabad has asked iran to push the houthis for a political compromise that riyadh can live with . the turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the houthis -- but in his visit to tehran last week , turkish president recep tayyip erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized iranian-turkish trade relations over rivalry in yemen , and emphasized a political solution for the yemeni conflict . the egyptians and the jordanians are still supportive of saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist riyadh in yemen . but whether they will go through with it is another matter . egypt has a long list of problems of its own , including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in sinai that it can not afford to lose , but also an eastern border with lawless libya that is increasingly a new front in cairo 's fight against jihadists . it is hard to see how egyptian general abdel fattah el-sisi can commit troops to a yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to egypt 's security . the same kind of domestic realities , including the threat from isis , will also prevent jordan from any significant contribution to saudi military efforts in yemen . these hard realities leave riyadh with two options . it can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same houthis that riyadh is attacking today . alternatively , given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops , riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of yemen . that is scenario that is very hard to contemplate . the iranians too are faced with stark choices . it is beyond tehran 's ability to tame the yemeni crisis . as tempting as it might be for tehran to see the saudis bleed in yemen , the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the middle east will undermine broader regional iranian interests . a political compromise that both riyadh and tehran and their respective yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic .\\xcb\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x92/-lrb- cnn -rrb- geography is , in part , destiny for italy : the country will always be a bridge between africa and europe , as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in the mediterranean so starkly shows . a surge of refugees this year , usually transported by smugglers on overcrowded vessels , has sought to reach europe via the libyan coast . a boatload of 900 migrants who embarked from libya are now feared dead in the latest sinking . over 10,000 were rescued off the coast of italy in the last week alone . european leaders are scrambling to deal with this emergency . there is a backstory here worthy of our attention , and it has to do with italy 's colonial past . many of the refugees involved in recent disasters come from some of italy 's former colonies in north and east africa , namely eritrea -lrb- occupied from 1890-1941 -rrb- and somalia -lrb- 1908-1941 -rrb- . as migrants , libyans are fewer in number , but libya -lrb- 1912-1941 -rrb- plays a central role in the current crisis as the main departure point for italy . italy 's empire never rivaled that of the british and the french in scope and longevity , but those who lived in its possessions were no less affected . indeed , the migrants traversing the mediterranean today form part of a century-long chain of migrations , expulsions , and exiles sparked by italy 's imperial ambition and commercial interests , the post-colonial anger of african leaders , and now mass economic desperation and political strife . long after the formal end of italian colonialism , these eritreans , somalis , and libyans have inherited the histories of influence and exploitation that shaped their home countries . it also affects the treatment of africans who settle in italy . libya is an example of the long reach of italian imperialism . libya was for a brief period an incorporated province of italy , on the model of french algeria , and libyan families still feel the devastating effects of the fascist dictatorship 's persecution of those who resisted italian occupation . over 100,000 libyan men , women , and children were deported to concentration camps deep in the desert in the late 1920s and early 1930s , and much of the ruling class was exiled or executed . col. moammar gadhafi , who ruled from 1969 to 2011 , was born during the italian occupation of his country , and his identity as a revolutionary was shaped by the example of resistance leaders such as omar al-mukhtar , who was hanged by the fascists in front of 20,000 of his people in 1931 . in 1970 , soon after he took power , gadhafi struck back , expelling the remaining italian community in libya . some of those people had grown up entirely in libya . they arrived in italy for the first time , at some of the same ports receiving migrants today . this political intervention did not spell the end of italian-libyan commercial dealings , which grew out of colonial-era relations that had made libya italy 's biggest oil supplier . since 2004 , italy and libya have been directly connected by the greenstream natural gas pipeline , which runs below the mediterranean , on the same axis as many migrant boats . commercial concerns , and the cozy relationship of then-prime minister silvio berlusconi and gadhafi , also lay behind a historic 2008 friendship treaty between italy and libya , which promised infrastructure and other aid to libya worth the equivalent of $ 5 billion as compensation for the damages inflicted by italy during the decades of colonial rule . until his death in 2011 , despite deals with italy and the european union to control departures from his borders , gadhafi intermittently used european fears of mass arrivals of migrants from libya as a political weapon . given europe 's geography , this weapon was pointed particularly at italy , libya 's former master , and the principal target of gadhafi 's post-colonial revenge politics . few italians learn about this colonial history and its legacies , even though episodes of racist violence against immigrants from former italian colonies and elsewhere are on the rise . upon her appointment in 2013 as minister of integration , c\\xc3\\xa9cile kyenge , an italian of congolese origin , faced ugly racist attacks from fellow italian politicians , including a comment that she looked like an orangutan . this climate has encouraged those who wish to rehabilitate the `` heroes '' of fascist imperialism . in 2012 , the town of affile built a publicly-funded memorial to general rodolfo graziani , known as `` the butcher of fezzan '' for his brutal repression of libyan resisters in the 1920s -- and for the massacre of ethiopian civilians he ordered in response to a 1937 attempt on his life . this colonial history and its long-term consequences can help us understand italians ' ambivalent reactions to the emergency on their southernmost shores . italian rescuers and activists work tirelessly and selflessly , and yet migrants who remain in italy are often subject to racist attacks . it is ironic that the name chosen for the sea rescue operation organized by the italian navy in 2013 was the slogan of the fascist 's dictatorship 's bid to control the mediterranean : mare nostrum . the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants in one year before it was discontinued due to european union budget restrictions . it seems to reflect the conflicted attitude of the italian government to its past aggressions : an admirable and courageous initiative -- advanced under an imperialist banner . the italian government deserves the full support of the european union as it responds to the current humanitarian crisis . but it also needs to address the failure of civic education about its colonial past . at 40 years old , italian prime minister matteo renzi is of a different generation than those who have sustained a politics of selective memory that is as dangerous in its own way for migrants as the boats now capsizing in the mediterranean . setting a new course on this issue is in italy 's interest , now more than ever .*\\x17\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd0,-lrb- cnn -rrb- the united states is failing its partners . if you want to understand one of the reasons that terrorism has been allowed to spread , it is that the majority of our partners do not have credible and capable special operations forces to respond to and defeat the current threat -- and we 're not doing nearly enough to address the problem . the trouble is that little of our foreign military financing -- including the recent counterterrorism partnership funds -- goes toward this vital facet in our efforts to counter extremism . as a result , violent extremists are making troubling gains . it 's not because we do n't recognize the problem -- nor that we do n't talk the talk . the 2015 national security strategy speaks to the importance of american-led partnerships , while the 2014 quadrennial defense review noted that we `` will rebalance our counterterrorism efforts toward greater emphasis on building partnership capacity . '' despite this apparent recognition , the united states is not where it needs to be and instead finds itself constantly responding to crises instead of heading them off because of the failure to prioritize long-term investment in special operations units in key partner nations . as a result of this neglect , since the attacks of september 11 , 2001 , we have seen deadly terrorist attacks not just in the middle east , but also in indonesia , india and sub-saharan africa . just look at the case of kenya . on september 21 , 2013 , al-shabaab jihadists attacked the westgate mall in nairobi , executing dozens of unarmed men , women , and children . less than two years later , at garissa university , al-shabaab jihadists attacked university dormitories , butchering almost 150 people . the perpetrators were separating the christians from the muslims and systemically executing the christians before detonating their suicide vests . during both incidents , the kenyan forces ' response was horribly executed . sadly , kenya is not the exception -- and it is by no means the only country missing out on vital u.s. assistance . in 2015 , u.s. taxpayers are providing $ 5.65 billion in foreign military finance , the majority of which is going to israel and egypt . kenya , meanwhile , was slated to receive a mere $ 1.2 million . nigeria , which is grappling with the rising threat of violent extremists in the shape of boko haram , has been afforded only $ 600,000 . simply put , the united states is spreading foreign military assistance too thin , while also failing to make necessary long-term commitments . it takes years to build special operations forces with credible capabilities . but although it is a worthwhile investment in terms of resources and energy , u.s. security assistance is not supporting enduring programs that build credible special operations partners . the reality is that we are not selling or giving our partners the capabilities that are critical to defeating the imminent threats they face today in hybrid warfare . we are also failing to develop long-term programs of record , bringing to bear all elements of national power as we did with plan colombia . this program , as well as the recent u.s. mission to support our filipino partners against abu sayyaf , demonstrates the power of a persistent presence by u.s. special forces when coupled with long-term funding and true interagency cooperation . true , the section 1206 global train and equip program fulfills some needs , but money from the program only provides limited support -- it is an annual appropriation for `` new and emerging '' counterterrorist operations or to support military and stability operations in which the u.s. armed forces are a participant . another program that builds special operations capacity , the joint combined exchange and training program , is also insufficient because it is ad hoc and meant to train u.s. forces first and foremost , not our partners . with all this in mind , it is clearly time for congress to step in and develop a dedicated program that builds out special operations in key nations to help bring the fight to the violent extremists in their own backyards . by investing everywhere , we are investing nowhere , which is why we need to make choices about where the united states and its allies will see maximum benefit . the united states has a choice -- reinforce failure and keep doing what we are doing or change course while we still have time . but to get this right , congress needs to start out by conducting hearings to find out in detail what current programs are providing to defeat imminent threats . this will mean asking the departments of state and defense to lay out a detailed budget with necessary metrics to show what capabilities these programs will provide to counter hybrid threats and when those capabilities will be complete . at the same time , congress needs to move beyond annual appropriations so that state and defense planners can do their job , too . attacks such as mumbai and westgate are easy to plan , do not require large amounts of ordinance and can be done in almost any location in the world -- we can expect to see a lot more of these . but with competent and capable partners who are interoperable with other special operations forces and law enforcement , we can start to make progress . it goes without saying that special operations forces are not a panacea for defeating terrorism , the causes of which are complex and diverse . but having credible special operations forces is a great first step . and for many of our partner nations , the special operations capability we give them may be the best chance they have at protecting their populations from extremists at home .i\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' it 's a familiar story in families across western india 's cotton production belt , where , a cotton lobbyist group claims , one cotton farmer commits suicide every eight hours . `` we get reports of two to three farmer suicides every day , '' said kishor tiwari , leader of the farmers advocacy group , vidarbha jan andolan samiti -lrb- vjas -rrb- . vidarbha , in the eastern region of the state of maharashtra , is known as the epicenter of the suicide crisis . according to vjas data , some 2,900 farmers from the area have taken their lives since 2013 ; more than 500 have died since the start of this year . there are a number of reasons for the hopelessness among vidarbha farmers . unseasonal rain and hail destroyed many crops earlier this year . but they 've also had to contend with the flipside : a plentiful harvest in 2014 drove prices down while production costs rose , leaving many farmers either lacking income or burdened with debt from loans taken out to help keep them afloat . last year was a record year for cotton production , resulting in a glut of cotton on the world market . india produced 40 million bales of the fiber in 2013/14 crop year , and is the second largest global cotton grower , after china . the record surplus of cotton in the global market pushed down prices hurting farmers , particularly in vidarbha , which is becoming increasingly reliant on cotton . `` our land mostly supports only two crops : cotton and soybean . but for the past few years , soybean yield has consistently been decreasing . so we mostly depend on cotton , '' said murali dhidkar , a local cotton farmer . he said in the past year , cotton prices had halved . `` i 'm getting around 50 dollars per quintal . just a year ago it was 100 dollars . i 've never seen such a low price . the costs of pesticides , fertilizers and seeds are increasing but the cotton price is falling down .

'' more than 50 % of india 's population is involved in the agricultural and allied sector , which contributes 18 % of the country 's gdp . government data shows 11,772 farmers committed suicide in 2013 across india . that is 44 deaths every day . earlier this month , prime minister narendra modi raised the amount of compensation paid for damaged crops , and lowered the threshold for farmers to claim payouts . however , that failed to appease farmers who are angry about the government 's land acquisition bill , which critics say makes it easier for the government to seize farmers ' land . modi 's ruling bjp party said the old rules were unnecessarily restrictive and the new bill is needed to spur investment and smooth the way for growth . the government is expected to reintroduce the new land bill when parliament reopens this week . on sunday , thousands of farmers gathered in delhi at a rally led by opposition congress party to protest against the bill . waving flags , they blasted modi government 's policies as `` pro-industrialist and anti-farmer . '' tiwari , of the farmer 's advocacy group , said the government needs to do more to stop the wave of suicides across the country . he said modi 's push to open bank accounts for every indian household , neglected to address the major concern in farming households of falling incomes . `` prime minister modi boasts about india rising , but he is not willing to talk about india dying , '' tiwari said . he says , for a start , the government should guarantee a better market price for cotton and waive farmers ' overdue debt . divisional commissioner of the vidarbha region , dnyaneshwar rajurkar said the state government is aware of the situation and is planning to roll out relief programs to help local cotton farmers . the plans include halving bank loan interest rates and waiving loans from private money lenders . rajurkar said the government is also planning to deploy doctors to counsel farmers in distress . just days away from her baby 's birth , kanhaiya said she worries about how she 's going to feed her family . `` i have to pay the loan back both to bank and private money lenders . i have no clue how i will pay the debt . once the baby is born , i will look for work . i will have to do labor jobs all my life to pay the loan , '' she said , despair in her voice . `` i did receive compensation from the local state government after my husband 's death . but it is very minimal . that does nothing to solve the grave problem i am in .

'' the 10 inmates , from australia , france , ghana , the philippines , brazil , nigeria and indonesia , had their petitions for clemency denied by president joko widodo in late 2014 . the executions , which will be carried out by firing squad , were planned for earlier this year but were postponed after several inmates filed separate legal challenges . on tuesday , the indonesian supreme court rejected reviews filed by french national serge atlaoui and ghanaian martin anderson . `` we 're just waiting for one more decision on the judicial review filed by zainal abidin and we hope the supreme court 's decision will come out tomorrow -lrb- friday -rrb- , '' spontana added . abidin is also a drug convict and the only indonesian citizen in the group . chan and sukumaran , members of the so-called `` bali nine '' convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot , tried to challenge the president 's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the state administrative court to hear their case . their lawyers have since filed another review at the constitutional court . the attorney general 's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options . australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths . in another sign that the execution date may be announced soon , spontana said veloso , 30 , was moved friday to nusa kambangan , which lies off the coast of west java . she has been held in a prison in yogyakarta , central java since 2010 . the supreme court rejected her petition for a judicial review in march but her lawyers were still preparing to file a second review on monday . opinion : why executions wo n't win indonesia 's drug war . according to her lawyers , veloso unknowingly carried drugs into indonesia and that she was set up by members of a drug syndicate . her entire family has traveled to indonesia to fulfill her last wish . older sister marites laurente told cnn friday that veloso wants to see parents , siblings and two young sons before facing the firing squad . laurente said that while her sister seemed resigned to her fate , the family still hopes for a stay in her execution . `` the chances are slim but we 're hoping for a miracle . that 's what we need , a miracle , '' she said . `` if president widodo kills her , he would kill an innocent person . so please stop them from executing her . '' at the time of the interview , lawyers had not informed the family about news of the attorney general 's orders . veloso 's father , cesar veloso , 59 , suffers from a heart ailment and seemed distraught about his daughter 's situation . `` if i find out that my daughter will be executed the next day , i will kill myself first , '' he told cnn late thursday . `` it 's like throwing my child away . she is innocent . i can not accept it .

'' gervais wrote . in the past three days , his tweet has been retweeted almost 30,000 times . a number of people insulted and threatened francis in response to the giraffe photo and others featuring her . on the website rebeccafrancis.com , there are photos of francis with other animals , including a lion , which other twitterers responded to . francis , who has appeared on the nbc sports network outdoor lifestyle show `` eye of the hunter '' and was the subject of an interview with hunting life in late march , responded in a statement to huntinglife.com on tuesday , which was posted on its facebook page . the death came about , she said , because she was asked by others on an african hunt to `` preserve '' him for the local people . '' -lrb- the locals -rrb- showed me this beautiful old bull giraffe that was wandering all alone . he had been kicked out of the herd by a younger and stronger bull . he was past his breeding years and very close to death , '' she said . `` they asked me if i would preserve this giraffe by providing all the locals with food and other means of survival . ... i chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and i do not regret it for one second . -lrb- the locals -rrb- did not waste a single part of him . i am grateful to be a part of something so good . '' according to the giraffe conservation foundation , there are about 80,000 giraffes in africa , a decline of 60,000 in the past 15 years . on a website called rebeccafrancis.com , where the photo is posted , francis describes herself as a longtime outdoors enthusiast and a fan of bow-hunting . `` i prefer bowhunting , and the animals i have taken with a bow include : a 10\\xc2\\xa01/2 ft. brown bear , black bear , shiras moose , alaskan moose , dall sheep , stone sheep , desert bighorn ram , rocky mountain bighorn ram , mule deer , whitetail deer , elk , mountain goat , antelope , arapawa ram , kudu , zebra , black wildebeest , giraffe , springbuck , blesbuck , lynx , badger , and squirrel , '' she writes . `` i have also taken many of the same species and more with a rifle .

'' kelley , 50 , was taken into custody at the atlanta airport wednesday after arriving on a flight from costa rica , deputy u.s. marshal jamie berry said . `` it was time to come home , '' kelley told people magazine about his decision to return to the united states . kelley has been wanted since 2004 , accused of noncustodial kidnapping and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution . his wife , genevieve kelley , who 's charged with the same crimes , turned herself in to authorities last year , just a few months after the case was featured on cnn 's `` the hunt . '' her trial is scheduled to start next month . the couple is accused of leaving new hampshire , kidnapping genevieve kelley 's daughter , mary nunes , and beginning a life on the lam when she was 8 years old . at the time , the child 's father , mark nunes , had full custody rights . the search for the three spanned the united states , canada and central and south america . it ended on monday , when scott kelley and mary nunes entered the u.s. consulate in costa rica and requested passports so they could return to the united states . the consulate notified u.s. marshals , berry said , and when kelley and nunes flew to atlanta on wednesday investigators were waiting for them . mary nunes , now 19 , was interviewed by investigators at the atlanta airport to ensure her health and safety and then allowed to continue to her final destination , berry said . previously , authorities had said her whereabouts were unknown . cnn new hampshire affiliate wmur reported that the daughter plans to testify at her mother 's trial . in a statement released through a private investigator he 's hired in the case , her father said that he was thrilled to learn mary is safe . `` we love mary and are overjoyed that she is alive and back in the us . our hearts and home are open to her , and we will do everything we can to insure she remains safe and healthy , '' mark nunes said in a statement . `` we remain concerned about her emotional and physical well-being . we look forward to the day our family is finally reunited . '' kelley 's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment . before allegedly fleeing the country , genevieve kelley had accused her ex-husband of abusing their child . investigators found no basis for the accusations and no charges were filed . on a facebook page defending her , supporters of the mother say she did what any parent would do under the same circumstances . photos on the page show her standing with friends holding signs that say , `` justice for gen ! children need protection . '' wayne rioux , who was then the police chief of whitefield , new hampshire , told `` the hunt '' that a video genevieve and scott kelley made , intended to prove their abuse allegations , aroused his suspicions . rioux watched the tape for `` any evidence of wrongdoing by mark nunes . '' `` but throughout the tape all i saw was this bizarre , strange conduct by the mother , '' rioux said , `` who was absolutely brainwashing the daughter and trying to get the daughter to say things against her daddy . '' attorney alan rosenfeld has argued that genevieve kelley had no other option than running away with her daughter , after a court-appointed guardian and social service agencies had said they did n't believe the abuse allegations . `` simply put , there was no lawful alternative to provide safety for this child , '' he said earlier this year , according to wmur . earlier this year , brazilian police tracked down victor arden barnard , another fugitive who 'd been featured on `` the hunt . '' the 53-year-old american pastor is accused of dozens of sexual assaults in minnesota . last year , the same day genevieve kelley was arrested , authorities in texas announced that in an unrelated case , remains found were confirmed to be those of another fugitive featured on the program , kevin patrick stoeser . stoeser , a u.s. soldier who was dishonorably discharged , pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars . remains of shane miller , another suspect featured on the `` the hunt , '' were found last year . and charles mozdir , another suspect who was profiled on the show , was killed in a gunbattle with authorities . cnn 's tricia escobedo and slma shelbayah contributed to this report .@\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' records are nice , but bruce mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . during her 14,000-mile journey , varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to mate , who is also the director of the marine mammal institute at oregon state university . `` for her to go to mexico , '' mate said , `` it 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . with only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' mate said . fourth baby orca born this season .{\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

the less harsh but restricted block ; the general population ; a privileged section known as the `` lifers block , \\'\\' for those serving a life sentence ; or the `` kitchen block , \\'\\' for those who work in the prison kitchen . `` at this point in time , we will figure out where he belongs in the population once the processing of hernandez is complete , \\'\\' duarte said . `` right now , he \\'ll be treated like a regular inmate when he walked into the door , but they will figure all that out . \\'\\' hernandez was sent immediately for processing after wednesday \\'s sentencing and jury conviction , duarte said . a news outlet helicopter followed hernandez \\'s transfer to mci cedar junction . prison officials will be concerned about hernandez \\'s safety and whether any enemies , gangs or headline-seeking inmates will try to hurt hernandez , who will become souza \\'s most famous resident . `` there could be prisoners with a beef who are out to get him , \\'\\' walker said . `` then he \\'s going to have to be separated , and it \\'s going to be challenging for prison officers and perhaps for him . `` the good news is that the superintendent of souza-baranowski is very smart and thorough and a decent human being , who i \\'m sure will do everything he can to keep mr. hernandez safe , \\'\\' walker added . `` the person at the top sets the tone . he \\'s fairly new and he \\'s doing everything he can to make sure the prison is as safe as possible . \\'\\' that superintendent , osvaldo vidal , could n\\'t be immediately reached for comment wednesday . because of his celebrity , hernandez may find himself signing autographs for other inmates and even guards , said larry levine , a former federal inmate who spent 10 years in high - and minimum-security prisons . `` there will be a lot of staff that will treat him like an animal that he is , but there will be other staff that will want his autograph and treat him like a star , \\'\\' said levine , who founded wall street prison consultants , which advises offenders and convicts heading to prison . in the long run , however , it may not matter much in what section of the prison hernandez does his time . about 90 % of the inmates in the maximum-security prison are locked in their cells for 19 hours a day , said walker , the legal advocate . `` it \\'s pretty grim , \\'\\' walker said . souza has slightly larger cells than most other massachusetts prisons , but not by much , walker said . even so , the cells are stark , small rooms of painted cinder-block walls with metal fixtures : a bunk mounted to the wall , a toilet and sink combination , a small writing shelf attached to the wall , and a nearby small stool affixed to the floor , walker said . there \\'s also a shelf for a small television , which must have a clear back for easy inspection , walker said . with the exception of the tv , which inmates can buy for under $ 200 , all furnishings are metal and bolted down to keep inmates from throwing them , she said . there are two windows : one roughly 4 by 20 inches with clear glass that looks outdoors to a wall , building or trees , and a tiny window on the cell door , which has two slots , for handcuffing in the middle and ankle cuffing at the foot of the door , she said . `` there \\'s very little to do , \\'\\' walker said of inmate life . `` it was built as a punishment facility . the thing in corrections is that you do n\\'t want people to like it there . some people have been there since it opened , and those people are excruciatingly bored or scared or both . \\'\\' to combat opiate use among inmates , prison guards use narcotics-sniffing dogs for inspections , walker said . `` it \\'s pretty pathetic . i have clients -lrb- in souza prison -rrb- who are heroin addicts who are trying to get clean , \\'\\' walker said . there also are gangs in the prison , she said . as for violence , one elderly inmate was beaten to death last year , walker said . if hernandez finds himself in solitary confinement , it wo n\\'t be pleasant , walker said . `` solitary confinement is a kind of torture that no one does well in . the lack of meaningful sensory stimulus and contact drives people mad , \\'\\' walker said . initially , `` prison officials may feel they have to put him there for his safety , but i hope not , \\'\\' walker said . `` it \\'s very hard time . \\'\\' opinion : the shame of aaron hernandez .\\\\\"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

'' a ballroom dancer , haslet-davis ' left leg would later be amputated below the knee . inside the forum , haslet-davis begged for whiskey . `` i just wanted the pain to go away . i only begged for the whiskey when i thought i was going to die . '' when someone removed adam 's shoe , an artery was spurting blood . his face got whiter and whiter , she said . his eye rolled back . she thought he was dead . at a hospital , she called her parents on her cellphone . she told them she was in a terrorist attack . `` i do n't think i have a left foot anymore , '' she told her father . `` i 'm in really bad shape and i really need to talk to you because this might be it . '' her father told her he was driving and it was illegal to pull over . `` i do n't care if it 's illegal . i need to talk to you because these might be our last words . i said i was in a terrorist attack at the boston marathon and adam is dead and this might be it for me . '' haslet-davis told the jury that , at the forum , her husband kept telling her he was sorry . `` that was all he could say . that he loved me . he was so sorry . '' her husband , she said , has since `` bravely admitted himself into a mental facility at the va hospital . '' after her testimony , haslet-davis walked slowly off the stand . she appeared to glare at tsarnaev , who did not look at her . earlier this week , prosecutors showed jurors an image of tsarnaev taken when he was in a holding cell . it was dated july 10 , 2013 -- the day of his arraignment on charges he deliberately set off the deadly bombs . he glares into the camera defiantly , his middle finger raised in a gesture that assistant u.s. attorney nadine pellegrini said showed a young man who was `` unconcerned , unrepentant and unchanged . '' on wednesday , tsarnaev 's lawyer , miriam conrad , sought to discredit the use of the image . she suggested the gesture had been presented to the jury out of context . on cross-examination of a deputy u.s. marshal , conrad showed the jury security footage from which the image was taken . in it , tsarnaev is seen looking into the camera touching his hair . moments before , he has two fingers up , forming what conrad called a `` v sign , '' before raising his middle finger . gary olivera , a deputy u.s. marshal for 14 years , admitted that the camera was encased in a reflective surface and tsarnaev could have been using it as a mirror . `` a lot of times people do that to get our attention , '' olivera said . also wednesday , jinyan zhao told the jury about her niece , lingzi lu , a `` beautiful nerd '' and graduate student at boston university who was killed in the bombing . lingzi lu was originally from china but was buried in boston . `` how she died , and why she died , it just felt like she is part of boston , part of city , '' her aunt said . `` the thinking is she should just be here . '' the family , zhao said , put a music box and some books in her casket . her mother put a bracelet on her wrist and touched her hand . later , her mother described her beautiful hand . zhao recalled what lu 's mother said to her : '' ` no matter what i do n't want to believe it is her hand . ' '' the brother and stepfather of sean collier also took the stand wednesday . collier was the mit police officer who was shot in his patrol car , another victim of the tsarnaev brothers as they tried to evade capture . sean collier always wanted to be a cop , said his brother . he was a child who viewed life in terms of right and wrong . either you did it or you did n't . `` we thought it was typical little boy stuff , but he never grew out of it , '' andrew collier told the jury . `` sean was always the one to spill the beans , '' said joe rodgers , 59 , who married collier 's mother , kelly , in 1993 . `` he was a cop from an early age . '' on a thursday night in april 2013 , massachusetts institute of technology police officer sean collier lay bleeding in his patrol car after being ambushed and shot in the head . his car door was open , and his foot was lodged between the gas and brake pedals . the officer who found collier testified at trial that he had wounds to the temple , neck and head . he was bleeding out as officers tried to revive him . collier would become the fourth victim of the tsarnaev brothers . the night still feels like a dream for rodgers . `` he had a hole in the middle of his head , '' rodgers said . `` he was shot to pieces . he was just laying there . my wife was touching him , and his blood was coming up in her hands . '' prosecution shows what it calls tsarnaev 's defiant message to u.s. prosecutors said the brothers killed collier because they wanted his gun . but their efforts to take it were thwarted by a safety holster . tamerlan , 26 , was killed in a chase and gunbattle with police that began with reports of an `` officer down '' at mit . less than two weeks after tsarneav was found guilty on every count , the jury deciding his punishment is hearing about the lasting impact of his deeds . earlier , mit police chief john difava told the jury that he hired collier , who fit in `` perfectly '' because of his policing style and engaging personality . the mit police , who are designated as special officers by the massachusetts state police , patrol the sprawling campus in cambridge . `` the atmosphere of the department changed since april 18 , 2013 , '' he said . `` there is sadness and a sense of loss . i think that it will be there for as long as that generation of officers remains . it was remarkable the amount of support we got from the community , but sean 's death hangs like a weight . '' difava has come to question whether he wants to continue on the force . `` policing is the only thing i 've done in my life , and i 've always tried to be good at what i do , '' he said . `` i lost one of my own . i have children at home and i 've always thought i would have been very , very proud for them to wear the uniform . now i 'm not so sure . '' rodgers said it took his wife , kelly , months to gain the strength to climb out of bed after losing her son . saturday was the second anniversary of the bombing . she cried all weekend . `` she was very strong , '' he said . `` she was a happy person . she was a good mother . since sean 's death , she 's very scared of anything that might happen to any of the other children . '' kelly became pregnant with sean after losing a baby that lived for a day or two , rodgers said . his birth lifted her out of depression . `` he was special , '' he said , adding that sean is now buried alongside the baby . rodgers said he still feels beat down two years later . `` there 's something missing , '' he said . `` thanksgiving and christmas will never be the same . '' collier 's brother andrew said , `` even when we 're having fun , there 's always a cloud over us . i miss sean . i miss everything about him . '' the prosecution is expected to rest friday , according to an official with insight into the prosecutor 's plans . poll : 53 % say tsarnaev should face death penalty . ann o'neill and aaron cooper reported from boston , ray sanchez wrote in new york .\\xbb\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe9(-lrb- cnn -rrb- if there was ever any doubt that the obama administration 's clean power plan is an energy policy plan , not a carbon reduction plan , all you have to do is look at how they treat nuclear energy . nuclear is our largest source of carbon-free energy , generating over 60 % of our carbon-free electricity . surely president barack obama 's climate plan , allegedly aimed at reducing the united states ' overall carbon emissions , would revitalize the nuclear industry , lead to increased plant construction and help meet aggressive carbon reduction targets . well , think again . james hansen , the former head of nasa 's goddard institute for space studies , said in 2013 that `` continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity 's ability to avoid dangerous climate change . '' yet wednesday , the white house will celebrate earth day and promote its work to fend off climate change , while strategically ignoring its largest tool to cut carbon emissions -- nuclear energy -- as well as the warning of one of the administration 's favorite climate scientists . despite the fact that nuclear power is carbon-free , the obama administration 's energy policy plan is biased against it . this bias is created by how environmental protection agency credits nuclear power in its models of both current emissions and plan implementation . epa 's modeling is divorced from reality . first , epa 's `` base case for the proposed clean power plan '' purports to depict the current state of the industry as the future would unfold without the clean power plan . this base case assumes no new nuclear construction and indicates the retirement of 96 of our 99 operating nuclear plants by 2050 . epa 's implementation modeling , `` option 1 -- state , '' shows exactly the same situation : no new construction and 96 retirements by 2050 . in other words , epa assumes that the nuclear industry is essentially phased out by 2050 . these assumptions are tremendously important because they determine how emission targets are set and what state actions will receive credit toward those targets . a group of university of tennessee graduate students made this point to epa at a public hearing last summer . using epa 's own data , the graduate students showed that epa 's energy policy plan creates incentives for states to shut down nuclear power plants and replace them with natural gas combined cycle plants . the students demonstrated that under this scenario , epa 's model shows emission reductions while real world emissions actually increase . president obama 's epa has shifted its position on nuclear energy and hidden that policy shift in a model . for example , when epa modeled the lieberman-warner bill in 2008 , the agency indicated 44 nuclear plants would need to be built by 2030 in order to achieve the carbon reductions mandated in the bill . epa 's modeling of the 2009 waxman-markey bill showed the need to build 275 new nuclear plants by 2050 to meet the carbon reduction targets in the legislation . where did this policy shift come from ? at a recent hearing in the environment and public works committee , mary nichols , chairman of the california air resources board , told congress that epa looked at california 's california global warming solutions act when developing its so-called clean power plan and that epa 's plan adopts the same policy choices -- limited credit for either nuclear or hydropower -- both of which are carbon-free . thus , epa is assuming legislative powers and is making policy choices that favor some forms of carbon-free energy over others . congress did not give epa the authority to make these choices , so instead they have hidden them in the modeling . for example , the same modeling that assumes the nuclear energy phaseout coincidentally shows robust development of renewables without any retirements between now and 2050 . this is a very favorable assumption albeit unlikely considering wind turbines and solar panels are commonly believed to last only 20 to 30 years before needing replacement . this anti-nuclear bias also is evident in obama 's recent executive order `` planning for federal sustainability in the next decade , '' which directs agencies to reduce their carbon emissions . even though existing nuclear plants generate carbon-free electricity , the executive order does not allow agencies to take credit for emission reduction from nuclear energy unless it is energy from small modular reactors . while i have long fought back on attempts for the federal government to tax carbon , i believe in an all-of-the-above energy strategy that provides our nation with energy security , and i have supported legislation that helps to clean the air . the administration says it shares these same interests , despite differing avenues to get there . the administration also believes in man-driven global warming , which should make nuclear energy its golden key . but the clean power plan and the president 's recent executive order demonstrate that the obama administration is neither serious about reducing carbon emissions nor pursuing an all-of-the-above energy strategy . if you think this administration supports nuclear energy , think again .\\x8d\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd7(-lrb- cnn -rrb- soon , america will be too fat to fight . forget about rampant diabetes , heart attacks and joint problems -- the scariest consequence arising out of our losing battle with the bulge is the safety of our country . in about five years , so many young americans will be grossly overweight that the military will be unable to recruit enough qualified soldiers . that alarming forecast comes from maj , gen. allen batschelet , who is in charge of u.s. army recruiting command . obesity , he told me , `` is becoming a national security issue . '' i was so taken aback by batschelet 's statement that i felt the need to press him . come on ! obesity ? a national security crisis ? the general did n't blink . `` in my view , yes . '' of the 195,000 young men and women who signed up to fight for our country , only 72,000 qualified . some did n't make the cut because they had a criminal background , or a lack of education , or too many tattoos . but a full 10 % did n't qualify because they were overweight . before you accuse me of sensationalizing , it 's that 10 % figure that worries general batschelet the most . `` the obesity issue is the most troubling because the trend is going in the wrong direction , '' he said . `` we think by 2020 it could be as high as 50 % , which mean only 2 in 10 would qualify to join the army . '' he paused . `` it 's a sad testament to who we are as a society right now . '' the problem is so worrisome for the army that recruiters have become fitness coaches , like the trainers on the nbc show , `` the biggest loser . '' yes , your tax dollars pay for army recruiters to play dolvett quince or jillian michaels to whip could-be recruits into shape with the hope they can diet and exercise their way to become real recruits . if they lose enough weight , they 're sent to boot camp . some make it ; many do n't . but , general batschelet told me the army must try . `` we are the premier leader on personal development in the world , '' he told me . `` we want to see you grow and become a leader . that is a great strength in our army . '' except the army never considered the type of growth it 's now contending with . nowadays `` personal development '' means working on both character and ... girth . the general , along with so many others in this country , is struggling with why so many americans , despite all the warnings , continue to eat too much and exercise too little . i have a theory . it ai n't pretty . but it 's got to be true : we just do n't care . `` the acceptance of obesity is prevalent , '' according to claire putnam , an obstetrician and gynecologist who believes obesity is a national crisis right now . `` when you look around you , 70 % of adults are overweight or obese . it 's seems normal , '' she said . just look at the numbers : more than one-third of u.s. adults are obese . seventeen percent of all children and adolescents in the u.s. are obese . that 's triple the rate from just a generation ago . so , maybe we should face the fact that we 've grown comfortable with our girth . it is crystal clear we have n't the foggiest idea of who needs to lose weight and who does n't . just the other day , twitter trolls scolded the singer , pink , for gaining weight . pink is not remotely fat . neither is selena gomez , haters . or britney spears , hecklers . if 70 % of us are overweight in this country , why are there so many willing to fat-shame people who are not remotely obese ? maybe it 's easier to criticize others for carrying extra weight than to admit we have a weight problem ourselves . because it is abundantly clear we are wallowing in denial . dr. putnam points to one of kaiser permanante 's medical questionnaires . you know , the paperwork patients are asked to fill out before they see the doctor . there is actually a box on the form that allows the patient to `` opt out of talking about obesity . '' some patients refuse to step on the scale . `` you want to be sensitive to that patient , '' putnam told me . `` you do n't want to nag . but , doctors need to step in and say we need to fix this . '' cnn 's chief medical correspondent , dr. sanjay gupta , agrees with putnam . `` perceptions of weight are a big part of the problem , '' he said to me . `` if a person is overweight -- as difficult as it is -- they ought to be told . you know , this issue reminds me of the issue with concussions . we should call them what they really are : a brain injury , not ` getting your bell rung . ' in the same vein , we should tell people who are overweight or obese that , clinically , they 're ` overweight ' or ` obese ' and at risk for just about every chronic disease in the book . '' in other words , chubby is not the proper way to describe a person who is obese . just like `` fat '' is not the proper term for pink or selena gomez . and , yes , semantics matter . according to the cdc , 81 % of overweight boys and 71 % of overweight girls believe they are just the right weight . we 've clearly lost our perspective on what 's normal when it comes to a healthy weight . so much so it 's becoming a national security problem . so what will it take ? the answer can not be the u.s army .\\x95\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc4*-lrb- cnn -rrb- for many girl scout troops it is officially cookie season . i feel guilty saying no to the sweet , enthusiastic girls standing outside my grocery store who use their smiles and newly practiced sales pitches to ask how many boxes i 'd like to order . after all , the organization is dedicated to enhancing girls ' character and confidence . and i have to admit that the samoas -lrb- now called `` caramel delites '' -rrb- are delicious . but as a physician who is passionate about health promotion , i politely tell the girls , `` no , thanks . '' i am concerned that every bite and every sale not only delivers an unhealthy snack , but also a dangerous nutrition message . and i 'm surprised that more doctors are n't speaking up about this . thin mints , the most popular cookie , contains refined white flour , sugar , partially hydrogenated oil , and high fructose corn syrup . the first ingredient in those caramel delites is sugar , but they also contain corn syrup and high fructose corn syrup , for a total of 6 grams of sugar per cookie . that 's a lot of sugar , and while some experts debate whether high fructose corn syrup is any worse than sugar , we agree that both , in the vast quantities we americans consume , contribute to obesity . but i 'm not only concerned about obesity . there are two other more insidious and dangerous risks to consider : cancer and heart disease . how could a cookie cause cancer ? let me explain . both high fructose corn syrup and sugar in the united states are largely made from genetically modified crops : 95 % of the sugar beets grown in the united states are gmo , as is 88 % percent of the corn . those crops are engineered to withstand spraying of the monsanto herbicide roundup ready . last month the international agency for research on cancer declared the key ingredient , glyphosate , a probable carcinogen . canola oil , another cookie ingredient , is also of concern : 90 % of rape seed -lrb- from which canola is produced -rrb- is gmo , too . suddenly those cookies seem less benign , do n't they ? if that is n't enough to dampen your cravings , recent studies have found a causal link between sugar and heart disease . and trans fats have been well documented to increase the risk of heart disease . a few years ago , this was a big story , and most products now boast that they have zero trans fats . in reality , companies are allowed to claim `` zero '' on the label if a serving contains less than 0.5 grams of trans fats . but often we eat more than one serving -- do you really stop at two cookies ? -- so rather than zero , your actual intake can be several grams . adding to the confusion , on the ingredient label , transfats show up as partially hydrogenated oils , including in thin mints , caramel delites , peanut butter patties , and other popular girl scout cookies . clearly the girl scouts ' leadership knows of the dangers ; they actively advertise on the boxes and web site those cookies contain `` zero grams trans fat per serving . '' `` you might be thinking , ` wow ! i 'm glad dr. maizes was n't my mom ! '' but my kids will tell you i love a good dessert . in fact , i make a mean cheesecake . an occasional home-baked cookie is not going to ruin a kid 's health . the problem is bigger than cookies . there is too little conversation on the hazards of sugar , white flour , gmos , and trans fats from those whom you would expect to call them out : physicians . perhaps this is not so surprising . after all , pediatricians , whose job is to protect the health of children , have a sum total of zero hours of required nutrition education in their residencies . nor do residency review committees require internists , family physicians or cardiologists to learn nutrition . and yet , there is compelling evidence that a diet rich in vegetables and fruit , whole grains , fish , nuts , and moderate amounts of dairy and alcohol , as well as avoiding smoking , obesity -- and exercising 30 minutes a day -- lowers overall mortality by 65 % . similar results were found in the study published under the name `` healthy living is the best revenge '' , which showed that eating a healthy diet -lrb- fruits , vegetables , beans , whole grains , nuts , seeds , and low meat consumption -rrb- would prevent 78 % of chronic disease , 93 % of diabetes , 81 % of heart attacks , 50 % of strokes and 36 % of all cancers . at the university of arizona center for integrative medicine , where i serve as executive director , we are seeking to remedy this . we include nutrition in all our training programs and have a new , 100-hour online course that is being pilot-tested at five pediatric residencies including stanford , universities of arizona , chicago , and kansas , and eastern virginia medical school . we also run an annual nutrition and health conference to address nutrition education for physicians in practice . educating doctors will not be enough . parents and schools have a role to play as well . and the girl scouts , with their enormous reach and influence , could do their part and choose a new fundraising item . times change and our traditions evolve . what if , this spring , the girls sold fresh fruit and vegetables , tomato plants or flowers , or even pedometers ? what if in addition to their characters and confidence we directly addressed the health of their bodies ? read more : what girl scout cookies taught me about life .\\xc1\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' espn , meanwhile , announced that mchenry would be suspended for a week . certainly mchenry should have known better than to have used such words , even if that 's what she was thinking , least of all because in our youtube age , such missteps always come to light . but while mchenry 's reaction could very well have been a result of an overblown sense of entitlement , evidence of a mean girl who never left high school , what 's also troubling is how quickly and gleefully the rest of us issued blame on mchenry without fully knowing -- or , it seems , caring about -- the other side of the story . the video that was released -- by the tow company -- was heavily edited and included only mchenry 's responses , not the comments of the employee who may have provoked her and contributed to an argument that clearly escalates as the video goes on . mchenry knew she was being taped ; at one point , she looks directly at the camera . the employee even threatens to make the video public . did mchenry keep going because she has that much of a self-destructive streak ? or because she truly could not help herself ? or was she confident that any video evidence would show that there were two people playing this particular game ? how britt mchenry could have responded . these days , there 's nothing we love more than an example of a celebrity fall from grace , whether it 's lindsay lohan or brian williams or britt mchenry , who was judged not on the facts but on what we take particular joy in believing : that the over-privileged and semi-famous do not necessarily deserve a fair trial . the high price of public shaming online . sure , mchenry probably feels entitled , but that 's our doing , too . we 're a society obsessed with putting celebrities on a pedestal -- celebrating them , compensating them . and yet when , in a moment of frustration and stress , mchenry lets the entitlement bestowed on her win out over taking a deep breath and walking away , we 're right there to demand to know what gives her the nerve . you know what gives her the nerve ? we do . -lrb- be honest : when is the last time you had a warm and fuzzy experience at the tow lot ? -rrb- . but we 're really no better than she is . the problem with social media , and our dependence on it , is that it allows people to present and receive whatever angle they want , biased or not , fair or not . it 's the `` power of the press '' without the objectivity or accountability demanded of the actual press . and it has enabled a dangerous vigilantism that makes those who use that power no different from the ones they are supposedly rallying against . think about it . who was worse : mchenry or the people who made that video public , and who did so without owning up to their part in the conversation ? who is worse : britt mchenry for childishly mocking a confrontational tow employee 's bad teeth , or the twitter masses who call for justice and `` the return of class '' -- who express views like , `` part of me feels bad for britt mchenry . poor thing actually believes she was hired for ` brains ' and ` education ' ? should n't they question whether , in fact , mchenry could have actually been standing up for herself ? sorry to break it to you , but these days , we 're all bullies . at least britt mchenry owns up to it .}\\x1d\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa19-lrb- cnn -rrb- it wo n't come as news to anyone in america today that the authority to make an arrest carries with it the potential to escalate to lethal force . but the seemingly innocuous genesis of police authority -lrb- initial stop and question , pulling someone over for a traffic violation -rrb- becomes significant because of the potential result -lrb- deadly force -rrb- . a minor traffic stop can be the springboard to a check for outstanding warrants . an initial stop can therefore lead to an arrest . and an arrest , we know , can have fatal results . in south carolina earlier this month , walter scott was the subject of a bench warrant for over $ 18,000 in unpaid child support , according to court records . that means that once he was stopped , he probably knew before the police officer that his own arrest was a foregone conclusion . but failure to pay child support is not a crime . at least , not in the traditional sense , though states do criminalize it . it 's rightly a civil matter . skipping child support court should similarly not be a crime either . this means that a bench warrant for failing to appear in child support court is n't about catching criminals -- it 's bill collection , only with a collection agency bristling with lethal and other weapons , and acting under color of law . this raises some serious questions about what exactly we want our heavily armed law enforcement officers to be doing . not all `` warrants '' are created equal . sometimes there are warrants for arrest , which are issued for alleged murders , drug dealing or sexual assault . then there are cases like the scott case . bench warrants for deadbeat dads are not arrest warrants for crimes . do n't get me wrong . deadbeat and absent dads are one of the most serious and often overlooked threats to our collective well-being today . forget the school-to-prison-pipeline . lousy parents are the prison pipeline ; particularly symptomatic of this problem are absent and deadbeat dads . still , given our justifiably dim view of deadbeat dads and child support court scofflaws , there is ultimately something dickensian in our remedy for enforcement . first , it 's important to keep in mind that nearly every instance of a family court 's intrusion into the private family unit is an undesirable event . yes , parents who ca n't resolve noncustodial support can turn to the courts , but once the courts and law enforcement are involved , they do things their way . and it almost always could have been avoided if the family could have resolved issues on their own . south carolina family courts enforce their child support orders through civil contempt proceedings . oftentimes and sadly so , papa is a rolling stone , and he falls behind on his payments . when a supporting parent has fallen behind , the court clerk sends dad an order to show up in court and explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating the payment order . at the hearing , that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt by showing that , well , he would love to pay , but right now he 's just in the process of getting himself together -- and he actually has a job interview tomorrow or some variation of the well-established language of support shirkers . the bottom line is dad can try to demonstrate he 's too poor to pay his child 's support . if he fails to demonstrate this inability , the court may hold him in civil contempt and actually imprison him , unless and until he purges himself by making the required child support payments . what follows is typically a macabre combination of a telethon , a game show and debtor 's prison . the defendant calls friends and family to crowdfund his down payment to get out of jail . if he ca n't , he 'll be stuck in jail until he does pay . and let 's face it : while it 's hard to drum up a lot of sympathy for deadbeat dads , jailing someone for their debt makes it a little difficult to , you guessed it , earn money to pay that debt . of course , since getting yelled at in court or sent to jail is unpleasant , dads have a remarkable ability to forget about court or get dates `` mixed up . '' the court 's remedy is to issue a warrant to bring dad to court . that warrant is not technically a criminal arrest warrant , but it sure seems like an arrest warrant if dad gets picked up on a friday afternoon and has to wait in jail all weekend to see the judge on monday . the point is this : some warrants are for the arrest of criminals . those are the warrants we 're familiar with , from `` law & order '' and every other cop show . other warrants , like those for contempt of a support order , have nothing to do with crime . they 're bill collection and are essentially civil in nature . yet we 've foisted that duty on the police as an ersatz collection agency . that 's right , the same police charged with arresting dangerous criminals are also dragooned into bill collection for the courts . when they run a driver 's name on a routine traffic stop and a deadbeat arrest warrant comes up , those same police who are armed with tasers and firearms are suddenly tasked with arresting a guy for failing to pay his bills . not because he 's dangerous . not because he 's a criminal . because he 's -lrb- breathtakingly -rrb- financially irresponsible . walter scott might have run because he knew the drill . he knew he was going to be arrested . he should n't have run . but he also definitely should n't have been shot . if he owed $ 18,000 in arrears , he definitely should n't have been looking to buy a mercedes , as his final words on tape at least seem to suggest he was planning to do . but whether or not he ran , the result would have been the same : if he had a bench warrant , he was going to jail , by force if necessary , even though he does not appear to have committed a `` crime . '' of course , the counterargument is : if we do n't arrest them , how else do we make deadbeat dads pay up ? there 's no easy answer . but the better question may be : why do we as a society not shun parents who do n't take care of their kids ? social rejection can be an even stronger motivator than the threat of arrest . arresting deadbeat dads is an extreme solution , and one that could be solved with less government intrusion , and more community involvement . the scott situation has highlighted some harsh truths . if we continue to arrest and jail deadbeat dads , we ca n't be surprised when an armed police officer uses excessive and deadly force to arrest them . while no one should be shot for failure to pay support , we 're also training police that a warrant is a warrant and an arrest is an arrest . are we comfortable as a society using an armed police force , empowered to use deadly force , to aid in collecting these bills ? if we are , then we have to be comfortable with the possibility that a delinquent dad is going to bolt when he gets stopped for a broken taillight . and if we 're comfortable with that , then we also have to be comfortable with the police giving chase , and making the arrest -- sometimes with whatever force they deem necessary in the moment . then , our only defense is to watch . and record . note : an earlier version of this article did not make clear that states do make failure to pay child support a crime .\\xb4\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x9e'-lrb- cnn -rrb- thinking about presidential candidates ? apparently , hormones are a major factor one should consider . according to one female businesswoman in texas , hillary clinton should n't be president because her hormones might make her so irrational she 'll start an unnecessary war . when george w. bush waged an unnecessary war in iraq -- was his testosterone to blame ? as cheryl rios , the ceo of go ape marketing , sees it : `` we 're built differently , we have different hormones . in the world that we live in , i understand that there 's equal rights and that 's a wonderful thing and i support all of that . i do n't support a woman being president . '' `` with the hormones we have there is no way we should be able to start a war , '' rios wrote in a facebook post . if rios is concerned about hormones impacting decisions in the oval office , she 'd be better off worrying about the male candidates for president . throughout history , male hormones have indeed impaired some male leaders ' decision-making . studies show that women leaders take fewer unnecessary risks than their male counterparts . if science does n't convince you , just google `` cheating politicians '' for the long and sordid list of men like arnold schwarzenegger , mark sanford and john edwards , whose hormones got the best of them . rios has taken a lot of flak for her `` biblically '' inspired beliefs , but she 's not the only one who 's arguing that a woman 's hormones are a legitimate leadership concern . time magazine declared hillary clinton the `` perfect '' age to be president , because she 's a postmenopausal woman who is `` biologically primed '' to lead . -lrb- she also happens to be a former first lady , senator and secretary of state . -rrb- . i 'm not joking . believe me , i wish i were . no wonder jon stewart left `` the daily show '' before the election cycle ramps up in full swing . if discussions about a candidate 's hormones are what we have to look forward to , the state of presidential politics is depressing indeed . but underneath the biochemistry debate is a much scarier consideration : the bias against women in the workplace is so well established that even in 2015 , a female candidate will be hard-pressed to get elected unless we have a serious discussion about ending gender bias . we want to believe that we live in a world where our daughters can do anything and be anything . and you 'd think they could -- they outnumber boys in college , graduate school and the work force . but what will limit their potential is not biochemistry or ability , but a bias in how women and girls are viewed . unfortunately , cheryl rios ' view of women is not unique . some people believe women have `` our place '' and that place is not at the table . they 'll tell your daughter to `` go for it '' but believe she is n't qualified to fulfill her dreams . in a compelling series about women and work , wharton school professor adam grant and facebook coo sheryl sandberg lay out the startling facts about the bias women face at work and the profound benefit of eradicating gender stereotypes . the evidence of bias is undeniable and the examples are endless . it 's overt : there are more men on corporate boards named john , robert , william or james than there are women on boards altogether . the bias is also covert : when students rate their favorite professors , they describe the men as `` geniuses '' and the women as `` nice . '' the bias is real , yet so many of us are blind to it . hillary clinton might not be the perfect candidate , but the fact that she is a woman will make her road to the white house a much steeper climb . that 's not just a problem for democrats -- it 's a problem for republicans , independents , everyone . the fact is , equality benefits everyone . it 's better for the bottom line -lrb- companies with more women in leadership roles make more money -rrb- . it 's great for kids because children with involved fathers are happier , healthier , and more successful . it 's great for marriages because couples that share responsibilities have stronger marriages . and it 's great for corporate teams because diverse teams and companies produce better results . our nation , our economy and our families would be much stronger if half of our companies were run by women and half of our households were run by men . it 's not enough to say to our daughters : `` you can be anything you want to be . '' what we need to say is : `` you can be anything you want to be , despite what some people might think -- and what they think is wrong . '' rios said that if clinton is elected , she is `` moving to canada '' because `` a female should n't be president . '' apparently rios knows as much about women and leadership as she knows about canada : kim campbell became the country 's first female prime minister in 1993 . correction : an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that canadians elected their first female prime minister , kim campbell .\\xf5\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x870-lrb- cnn -rrb- u.s. president barack obama 's recent explanation of how his administration will engage with the middle east is far from reassuring to the region . in his interview with tom friedman from the new york times on april 4 , obama explained u.s. foreign policy moves on iran and cuba , which friedman described as the `` obama doctrine . '' he stated that `` we will engage , but we preserve all our capabilities . '' by capabilities , the president must mean the tools , whether diplomatic , economic or military , to protect and defend u.s. interests . the doctrine is significant because it provides greater clarity about the u.s. policy under the rest of obama 's presidency . instead of the `` new beginning '' that the president outlined in his much discussed cairo speech in 2009 , u.s. policy in the middle east remains mired in a contradiction between principles and action on the ground . for example , the president asserted in the interview that `` the u.s. 's core interests in the region are not oil , are not territorial ... our core interests are that everybody is living in peace , that it is orderly , that our allies are not being attacked , that children are not having barrel bombs dropped on them , that massive displacements are n't taking place . '' yet , at the very moment that the president was offering this assessment , u.s. allies , such as the arab gulf states , jordan , lebanon and the legitimate government in yemen , found themselves under serious threat and attack ; the syrian regime was continuing to relentlessly bomb its own citizens ; and the middle east was faced with the biggest refugee crisis in its history . implementing the core u.s. interests outlined by obama in the interview is clearly not working . there exist grave doubts about whether the current u.s. administration is indeed ready to deploy the above-mentioned `` capabilities . '' it seems that the u.s. will only use them when its national security is at stake . and those core interests are limited to dealing with terrorism and nuclear proliferation only and not the broader aspects mentioned by the president . the use of drone technology across the region , the military strikes being conducted against isis in iraq and syria and the framework agreement between iran and six world powers on the iranian nuclear programs are cases in point . establishing a region `` living in peace '' is clearly not an instance where those capabilities will be deployed and is not part of the so-called obama doctrine . in the same vein , the majority of the arab world and the entire gulf region look at the recently announced iran nuclear deal with a sense of suspicion and trepidation . having directly experienced the problematic interventionist iranian policies for decades , the arab world is simply not ready to give tehran the benefit of doubt on any regional issue . but neither is it ready to trust u.s. assurances that outside a nuclear agreement , the u.s. will indeed put forward a concerted strategy to contain iranian influence throughout the region or to defend the gulf cooperation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- states against any iranian threat . instead , the fear is that as long as iran abides by any agreement that might come into force later this year , the u.s. will negate , downplay , or simply ignore those iranian actions that the arab world considers as direct threats . here , actions speak louder than words and unfortunately one sees only the latter coming from washington . at a time when the region is faced with unprecedented turmoil and transition , the president even shifted the blame and directed his criticism toward the arab world . when he referred to `` our sunni arab allies '' the president gave an exaggerated picture by saying `` populations that , in some cases , are alienated , youth that are underemployed , an ideology that is destructive and nihilistic , and in some cases , just a belief that there are no legitimate political outlets for grievances . '' what obama failed to do is to highlight that this statement is in fact also applicable to iran . in his interview , he never questioned iran 's appalling record on human rights , treatment of the political opposition , and minorities ' rights , among other disturbing issues . moreover the reference to saudi arabia being one of the `` sunni arab allies '' ignores the fact that there are non-sunnis living in the arab gulf and adds to the existing destructive sectarian tensions as well as the sensitivity of the non-sunni arabs . equally , the assertion that `` the biggest threats that they -lrb- the arab states -rrb- face may not be coming from iran invading . it 's going to be from dissatisfaction inside their own countries ... '' is another example of the detachment from reality . based on a gulf research center study , when there are 48 militia groups supported by iran operating in iraq and tearing apart the very social fabric of that country , it is simply naive to suggest there is no iranian threat . the bottom line here is that u.s. and arab national security interests are no longer on the same page . ever since the u.s.-led invasion of iraq in 2003 , those interests have increasingly diverged to the point that the arab world is tired of false promises . the ongoing operation of ten mostly arab coalition countries to protect the legitimate government of yemen is simply the latest move that underlines the determination of arab countries to take matters in their own hands . the gcc states may accept the invitation by the u.s. president to come to camp david , his maryland country retreat , and have an honest discussion with him about the situation in the region . but they question the value of being invited for purposes of being reassured when they are already being informed beforehand of what is wrong with them . the truth of the matter is that `` the region is -lrb- not -rrb- working '' and that misguided u.s. leadership and policies are among the reasons for the enduring tragedy in this region . unfortunately , the `` obama doctrine '' does little to change this and may in fact make matters worse .\\xd6\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' granted , that 's not because republicans convinced the country that they were the party of women . but it is noteworthy that democrats who overtly pandered to women at the expense of real issues -lrb- and men -rrb- crashed and burned . to wit : . in colorado , sen. mark udall was nicknamed `` mark uterus '' for all the time he spent fear-mongering on women 's reproductive issues , only to end up , according to exit polls , eight points ahead among women . his opponent , cory gardner , finished 17 points ahead among men . in new york , a democratic candidate for congress , martha robertson , drew laughs from the audience during a debate for accusing her opponent of engaging in a `` war on women . '' to repeat , she was a woman , a democrat , in new york . in louisiana , sen. mary landrieu sought to give her ailing campaign a boost in by part blaming sexism for democrats ' lack of popularity in the south . not surprisingly , southerners voted for her opponent , bill cassidy . in texas , where liberal wendy davis ran almost entirely on an abortion-rights platform , she accused republicans of sexism for daring to scrutinize her inaccurate biography . her opponent , greg abbott , won by 20 points , and davis only ended up with 47 % of the women vote . whether in texas or colorado , new york or louisiana , voters made it clear they cared about more than just reproductive issues and were n't going to be bullied into voting democratic by false cries of sexism . but while democrats were screaming about the republicans ' `` war on women , '' few in the media acknowledged that the democrats ' deficit among men was actually greater than the republicans ' deficit among women . exit polls in 2014 showed that men voted for republicans over democrats by a 16-point margin , and women voted for democrats by only a four-point margin . regardless of whom republicans run for president , hillary clinton will most likely get the women vote . what she needs are men . so instead of running a woman-centered campaign , she might want to figure out a way to court the other sex .T\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x92&-lrb- cnn -rrb- marco rubio is all in . the republican senator from florida has announced that he is seeking the republican presidential nomination , running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the american dream . with his youthful energy and hispanic roots , it 's tempting to see rubio as the new blood that the gop needs in order to compete against hillary clinton in 2016 . yet rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues : immigration reform and cuba relations . he holds little appeal to latino voters . and unless he can offer new ideas , his climb to the republican nomination will be steep . back in 2013 , rubio was a member of the senate `` gang of 8 '' that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform , including a path to citizenship for the nation 's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants . he later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from house republicans , and now says he favors a piecemeal approach , starting with securing the border . his retreat on immigration means that rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive republican presidential candidates . that 's a shame , for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to latino voters . instead , rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration . he believes that president obama 's deferred action program , offering deportation relief to young immigrants , should be ended . he has stated that the president 's executive action on immigration , on hold pending a circuit court review , sets a `` horrifying precedent . '' meanwhile , both the deferred action program and president obama 's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by hispanics . no wonder the research firm latino decisions reports that , `` we find no evidence that rubio 's candidacy will draw significant latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally . '' so , if rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow hispanics , he is mistaken . at a private breakfast monday for supporters , rubio described running against `` one candidate in the race who 's from yesterday , and one who wants to take us back to yesterday . '' but when it comes to cuba policy , rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past . over the weekend , he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous . he has warned that cuba is taking advantage of the united states . here , he is an increasingly lonely voice . most americans support better relations with cuba , as do a majority of cuban-americans . by clinging to the notion that isolating cuba is better than engaging with the communist country , rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership . immigration and cuba policy aside , rubio 's political philosophy will be a tough sell to hispanics . he is a fierce opponent of `` obamacare '' and wants the law repealed . however , the affordable care act has led to a 12.3 % drop in the hispanic uninsured rate , making latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance , thanks to the law . -lrb- in fact , rubio signed his own family up for `` obamacare '' on the washington exchange , taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers . -rrb- . rubio favors smaller government , while latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less . and though rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans , the new york times has noted that latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue . sure , rubio is young and charismatic . but his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding , rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate . in february , he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website politico . another rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals . consider that his fellow contender for the gop presidential nomination , sen. rand paul of kentucky , has been willing to present new ideas to the republican base , such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana . or that another gop candidate for president , sen. ted cruz of texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand . by comparison , rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing republican voters . with his early leap into the 2016 race , marco rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of gop leadership . unfortunately , a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for rubio , and not for latino voters .*\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x825-lrb- cnn -rrb- the nfl draft begins on april 30 , and while the tampa bay buccaneers are on the clock with the no. 1 overall pick , the clock is still ticking for another team -- the new england patriots -- as they await the results of the `` deflategate '' investigation , which has already lasted more than three months . in january , the nfl launched an investigation into the patriots to determine why 11 of the 12 game balls they provided for the afc championship game were underinflated . the league hired attorney ted wells -- who also investigated the miami dolphins bullying scandal -- to run the investigation . jeff pash , the nfl 's executive vice president and chief counsel , is assisting wells in the effort . the league has also retained renaissance associates , an investigatory firm with sophisticated forensic expertise , to assist in reviewing electronic and video information . but three months later , it 's still not clear when the investigation will be completed and when the findings will be announced . `` we have not put a time frame on ted wells , '' nfl commissioner roger goodell said march 25 . `` we asked him to be thorough , complete and when he is finished with that -- he 'll give that to us and to the public in general . '' on monday , cnn reached out to wells and the nfl for an update on the investigation but has not heard back . on january 18 , the patriots beat the indianapolis colts 45-7 to advance to the super bowl . they scored 28 of their points in the second half -- after game officials had pumped the balls back up to their regulation pressure -- so it 's unlikely that the ball pressure made much difference in the outcome of the game . in february , colts general manager ryan grigson said at the nfl combine in indianapolis that prior to the afc championship game , his team notified the league of its concerns about the footballs . `` we went into the game , we had some issues , but we are going to do what we can and that 's to participate with the league and the investigation and wait until the wells report comes out , '' grigson said february 19 . `` we really have no other recourse than to wait until that investigation comes out . '' each team provides a dozen footballs to the referee for testing two hours and 15 minutes before kickoff . the home team also supplies 12 backup balls , and for outdoor games , the visiting team has the option of bringing another 12 balls . nfl rules state the referee `` shall be the sole judge as to whether all balls offered for play comply with these specifications . a pump is to be furnished by the home club , and the balls shall remain under the supervision of the referee until they are delivered to the ball attendant just prior to the start of the game . '' the ball attendant brings the footballs to the field , and ball boys keep them on the sideline . it 's been speculated that deflated footballs are easier to grip for the quarterback and receivers . however , there is n't a consensus by players on that view . the day after the afc championship game , patriots quarterback tom brady called the accusation of using deflated footballs `` ridiculous . '' a few days later , he told reporters he has always played by the rules . following a practice on january 24 , patriots head coach bill belichick said that the patriots try to do everything right . `` at no time was there any intent whatsoever to try to compromise the integrity of the game or to gain an advantage , '' belichick said at the time . `` quite the opposite , we feel like we follow the rules of the game to the letter in our preparations , in our procedures . '' after arriving in arizona for super bowl xlix , patriots owner robert kraft said he expects the nfl to apologize if the investigation does not uncover any wrongdoing . `` many jump to conclusions and made strong accusations against our coach , quarterback , and staff questioning the integrity of all involved , '' kraft said then . `` if the wells investigation is not able to definitely determine that our organization tampered with the air pressure in the footballs , i would expect and hope the league would apologize to our entire team and in particular coach belichick and tom brady for what they have had to endure this past week . '' in terms of punishment , the patriots could be fined and/or docked a draft pick . after spygate in 2007 -- where the patriots illegally videotaped the new york jets defensive coaches ' signals -- the league took away a patriots first-round draft pick , fined the team $ 250,000 and fined belichick $ 500,000 . however , it 's not expected that the punishment would be that serious for deflategate . in march , two other teams were punished by the nfl for different rules violations . cleveland browns general manager ryan farmer admitted to using his phone to text the browns staffers during games during the 2014 season . it 's against the rules to use certain electronic devices during games . farmer will be suspended without pay for the first four regular-season games of the 2015 season , and the browns were fined $ 250,000 . during the suspension , farmer can not be involved in any team matters and is prohibited from being at the browns ' offices , practice facility or at browns games . according to the league , there was no evidence in the nfl 's review that browns ownership or any other team executives had knowledge of the prohibited conduct . the atlanta falcons acknowledged the use of prerecorded crowd noise , which is also a violation of nfl rules , during home games in the 2013 and into the 2014 season . the rule states that `` at no point during the game can artificial crowd noise or amplified crowd noise be played in the stadium . '' the falcons were fined $ 350,000 and lose their fifth-round draft pick in the 2016 nfl draft . the league 's investigation found that the falcons ' former director of event marketing was directly responsible , but that senior executives , including team president rich mckay , were unaware of the use of the piped-in crowd noise . still , mckay was suspended from the nfl competition committee starting april 1 . starting june 30 , he can petition goodell for reinstatement to the committee . as to what happens to the patriots , and when , it 's still anyone 's guess . but goodell has previously stated that a violation of rules will be taken seriously . `` whenever there is a charge potentially of the violations of our rules , we take it very seriously and that 's our obligation , '' goodell said in march . `` that 's our obligation to the other 31 clubs . ted wells will be going through the report . if there is anything that we as a league did incorrectly we will know about it in that report .

      "b\"\\xdc:london -lrb- cnn -rrb- british police investigating a spectacular heist in the heart of london 's jewelry district said friday they knew a burglar alarm went off but did n't respond . southern monitoring alarm company called the metropolitan police service , also known as scotland yard , at 12:21 a.m. april 3 to report that the burglar alarm had been activated at hatton garden safe deposit ltd. , mps said in a prepared statement . `` the call was recorded and transferred to the police 's cad -lrb- computer-aided dispatch -rrb- system , '' the statement said . `` a grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required . we are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call . this investigation is being carried out locally . `` it is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident . '' the theft was so big that police have n't come up with a value for what was stolen . over the four-day easter holiday , thieves broke into the vault of hatton garden safe deposit ltd. and might have been able to take as long as four days to rifle through the boxes . a former police official in london has speculated that the loss could run to # 200 million , or $ 300 million , in a remark widely reported by news media . numerous british news organizations put the value of the loss in the hundreds of thousands of pounds . detective chief inspector paul johnson of the london metropolitan police flying squad said police were still identifying the owners of ransacked safe deposit boxes and trying to contact them to learn what had been lost . the british tabloid the daily mirror claimed friday to have obtained closed-circuit tv footage that captured the robbery being carried out . the video showed people inside the building dressed like utility workers with their faces covered . they carried large bags , what looked like drill equipment and other tools , then exited with trash bins . toward the end of the video , a white van can be seen on a street during daytime with individuals loading back their gear and the trash bins . british police told cnn they have not released any video of the heist . when asked about the video published by the daily mirror , police said they could not confirm that it was footage from the hatton garden robbery and that officers have not seen that particular video . the daily mirror published time-stamped images it said showed that the thieves had been -- as was feared -- in the vault for days . the mirror 's time stamps , which cnn has not been able to independently verify , show employees locking up for the weekend at 9:19 p.m. on thursday . if the footage , and its interpretation by the newspaper are correct , at least six people were involved in the heist . just four minutes later , the first of the thieves , nicknamed `` mr. ginger '' by the newspaper for his red hair , appears in the building holding a black bag . he goes downstairs toward the vault . at 9:27 p.m. , a street camera shows a white ford transit van pulling up to an alley beside the hatton garden safe deposit building . men are seen dragging trash bins down the alley before the van drives away , leaving the men behind . inside the building , at 9:30 p.m. , the camera records a thief nicknamed `` the gent '' for his natty clothing -- though he also wears a hard-hat and a high-visibility jacket labeled `` gas '' on the back . a minute later , `` mr. strong '' appears , wearing a builder 's hat and carrying steel supports , which the newspaper speculates could have been used to support the diamond-tipped drill used to smash through the wall of the vault . at 9:36 p.m. , mr. strong and a thief nicknamed mr. montana for the logo on his hooded sweatshirt roll in trash bins , one of which might have contained , according the mirror , the 77-pound drill that bored through the reinforced seven-foot concrete wall to reach the vault . it is unclear , but the thieves may have spent the night in the basement in or near the vault . at any rate , according to the daily mirror , no more activity is seen above ground until friday morning , shortly before 8:00 . the white van returns , is loaded in two minutes , and drives off again . on saturday evening , mr. ginger returns , two days after he was first seen . the newspaper says is wearing latex gloves and carrying a black sack . he goes downstairs toward the vault . saturday evening also marked the first appearance of the tall man , who helped carry some of the loot out of the building . early sunday , mr ginger , the tall man and a robber nicknamed the old man are seen to be active . the tall man and the old man struggle to move a bin before they drag it outside . the old man leans on the bin , struggling for breath , and reveals the side of his face to the camera . a white van arrives by the alley and the men start loading equipment on it , including several trash bins . three men get into the white van and , at 6:44 a.m. they are gone . the heist would not be reported to police for two more days , on tuesday morning when employees of the company arrived for work . police said thursday there was no sign of forced entry . johnson said the thieves appeared to have gained access to the vault through the shaft of an elevator that is used by several businesses in the building . the thieves disabled the elevator on the second floor of the building -- which would be called the third floor in the united states -- then climbed down the elevator shaft into the basement , he said . once there , he said , they used a drill to bore through a 6-foot-thick wall and gain access to the vault where the safe deposit boxes were . people with knowledge of the area have speculated that cash and jewels were probably taken . some jewelry businesses reportedly stored some of their jewels in the boxes rather than leaving it in their stores over the holiday weekend . johnson said the scene in the vault remained chaotic as police continued their forensic examination . he said the

      "b\"\\x9c5los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- she 's one of the hottest and most successful latinas in hollywood , but now sofia vergara is playing defense in a legal battle initiated by her ex-fiance : he wants to keep the two frozen embryos from their relationship , both female . the 42-year-old actress and star of the hit tv sitcom `` modern family '' split from businessman nick loeb in may 2014 . loeb is suing the colombian-born actress in los angeles to prevent vergara from destroying their two embryos conceived through in vitro fertilization in november 2013 , according to published reports by new york daily news and in touch magazine . the lawsuit cited by the two publications , however , lists the plaintiff as `` joe doe '' and the defendant as `` jane doe . '' the suit does n't identify the names of the actual litigants . instead , the suit asks the court to advance the matter anonymously to protect the two individuals ' privacy . the two publications cited unidentified sources in their reports . on tuesday , loeb 's attorney abram moore confirmed in a statement that loeb filed the lawsuit . representatives for vergara declined to comment . court papers allege the couple created the embryos while they were engaged , and their plan was to eventually have children together . on `` modern family , '' vergara plays gloria delgado pritchett , an eccentric and voluptuous colombian immigrant who in recent episodes had a baby . but the sitcom make-believe is far from what vergara is dealing with now . the lawsuit states the embryos should not be destroyed under any circumstances by jane doe until both parties reach an agreement . the suit also names as a defendant the clinic where the embryos are being held , the art reproductive center in beverly hills . the center did n't respond to a message seeking comment friday . according to the legal paperwork , the ex-couple had already used two surrogate mothers , one being a close friend of jane doe 's , in an attempt to have children . however , neither of the implantations was successful . in his own statement , loeb said he wants to implant the embryos in a surrogate and bring them to term , but he does n't want any money from the egg donor . his statement does n't directly identify vergara as the donor , other than referring to his `` ex . '' `` i have previously offered to waive any parental or financial responsibilities or obligations on the part of my ex , and to even give her the opportunity to be involved with the child in the future , should she change her mind , '' loeb said . he believes that `` life begins at fertilization , '' he said . `` creating an embryo in the natural way can lead to parenthood obligations , even where a man does n't want to become a father . where a man does want to become a father , and wants to impose no obligations on the other party , he should have that corresponding right . however life comes to be created , it should have no determination on either the rights of wanting to be or the requirements of having to be a parent , '' loeb said . in an interview with abc in april 2013 , while the couple was still engaged , vergara spoke of how she helped create embryos and what motivated her to do it . `` we just wanted to plan ahead . my boyfriend nick is three years younger than me and he 's never had a son . i have my son , manolo , so it 's not that import -lrb- ant -rrb- ... you know , it 's not like an emergency for me to have another kid . for nick , yes , because he 's never had a baby , '' vergara said . during the interview she seemed excited about wanting children with loeb . `` i already froze some eggs so , you know , i wanted to take advantage of science . why not ? '' vergara said . the abc anchor asked vergara how far along she was in the process , to which the actress replied : `` i took them out already . they 're in a refrigerator . '' laughing , she added , `` hopefully they 'll be fresh by the time i use them . '' the case has led to questions about who has the right to embryos . typically , a prior legal agreement between a couple spells out who has ultimate authority , said fertility specialist dr. david tourgeman , who 's not involved in this case . `` usually when embryos are created , whether the couple is married or just consenting adults , there 's usually a power of attorney that is described to these embryos , if they are frozen for future use , '' he said . in most cases , the mother or the origin of the egg is given power of attorney , although anyone can make a request , tourgeman said . if there 's a disagreement , the courts usually get involved to decide who legally owns the embryos , he said . `` the documents that were signed during the fertility process will probably only apply in the case of death of one of the partners , '' he said . `` in the scenario where there 's a disagreement as to who these embryos belong to , it will usually be decided by a court of law . '' but experts say this lawsuit is bringing up a lot of interesting issues . `` religious , moral issues , to legal and contract issues . when does life begin ? are these embryos alive ? '' said california attorney vance owen . `` to catholics , for example , conception marks the beginning of life . to abortion advocates , the child has to be in a more advanced state , perhaps the third trimester , so it 's a very interesting time to be discussing these life issues , '' owen said . owen said loeb has a case because no court in california will allow the destruction of the embryos if both parties disagree . `` this case is a gray area of law because it 's new , '' owen said . `` it 's developing as we speak , '' he said . `` it 's a question , i think , of whether to decide if these frozen -lrb- embryos -rrb- are human beings or whether they are property . since they are unborn , some states in the united states look at these -lrb- embryos -rrb- not as life , but as property . '' owen said the lawsuit reportedly filed by loeb will now open new issues , and a california court will have to decide to whom the embryos belong . `` these embryos are not inside her body , '' he said . `` they are in a nitrogen tank in a clinic in beverly hills , so there the planned parenthood of central missouri vs. danforth case can not be used by the sofia vergara team to allege that the -lrb- embryos -rrb- would present some danger to her health as they did in that case . '' in that case , the u.s. supreme court declared a statute that requires parental and spousal consent for abortions to be unconstitutional . the lawsuit comes as vergara promotes her new movie , `` hot pursuit , '' with co-star reese witherspoon . vergara is now reportedly engaged to actor joe manganiello . cnn 's krecyte villarreal and stella chan contributed to this report .G\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd30-lrb- cnn -rrb- on april 20 , 2010 , a final cement seal of an oil well in the gulf of mexico failed , causing what has been called the worst environmental disaster in u.s. history and taking the lives of 11 rig workers . for 87 straight days , oil and methane gas spewed from an uncapped wellhead , 1 mile below the surface of the ocean . the federal government estimated 4.2 million barrels of oil spilled into the gulf , but bp argued in court that it was much lower . a judge ruled bp was responsible for the release of 3.1 million barrels . imagining daddy : a rig worker 's daughter and her dreams . there were dire predictions of what would follow . environmentalists and others braced for an environmental collapse on a massive scale . scientists continue to study environmental impacts , but five years after the spill , the long-term negative effects remain unclear and are , in many cases , highly disputed . bp , the company that caused the spill , is eager to point out it appears the gulf of mexico is healing itself . bp 's vice president of communications , geoff morrell , said there is no doubt birds , fish , turtles , sub-sea vegetation and even sediment species were all affected in the immediate aftermath of the spill . email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com . `` there 's no question about that , '' morrell said . `` but they have also , according to the data , bounced back and are recovering strongly . '' `` and there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species . '' while bp 's assessment has not been disproven , the government suggests it 's too soon to make long-term conclusions about the rebounding health of the gulf . shortly after bp released its own five-year report that concluded the gulf has largely recovered , the trustees of the natural resource damage assessment called bp 's report `` inappropriate as well as premature . '' the trustees , a collection of government agencies tasked with determining the extent of the damage from the macondo spill , released a statement , saying , `` we know that the environmental effects of this spill are likely to last for generations . '' one government official familiar with the trustee 's assessment accused bp of having `` cherry-picked '' positive results while ignoring others , something bp denies . most long-term scientific studies on environmental disasters take longer than the five years that have passed . studies so far have shown a variety of negative impacts on wildlife immediately after the spill , but others show some of those species are bouncing back . fish landings in the gulf , the amount of fish caught by the fishing industry , have returned . oysters are also recovering in many areas . and according to the food and drug administration , tests on edible seafood show no excess hydrocarbons in the region 's food supply . the spill 's effects on other species are less clear . dolphins are dying at an accelerated rate along the gulf coast , and even more so in louisiana where the oil hit the hardest . but the dolphin `` mortality event , '' as the government calls it , began months before the spill . studies suggest the diseases dolphins suffer from in places like barataria bay , louisiana , could be caused by oil exposure , but direct links to the 2010 macondo spill have not been proven . seaside sparrows in the gulf are also showing signs of strain , and some studies cite oil as contributing to reductions in their overall abundance . while aerial surveys taken in 2010 suggest tens of thousands of sea turtles were exposed to oil in coastal waters , government agencies are still gathering data and have not concluded if the spill will have long-term effects on sea turtle populations . but perhaps the greatest unknown is what , if anything , millions of gallons of oil on the deep seafloor are doing to the overall environment of the gulf itself . oceanographers have been tracking the residue from the macondo well as it has settled on the bottom of the ocean . mandy joye , an oceanographer with the university of georgia , has used underwater robots to capture soil samples and run tests to determine just how far the oil has traveled . her research and other studies show bp 's oil is scattered in patches across more than 1,200 square miles of the seafloor . according to joye 's study the oil residue exists in thin layers in some areas of the seafloor and thick pockets in others . joye is trying to determine how the oil deposited on the seafloor -- estimated to be about 10 million gallons -- affects the microbial community of organisms that exists in the deepwater ocean . `` that stuff 's not going to stay put . it 's going to move around , '' joye said . she said that right now , there is just no way to tell if it will have an impact . `` there 's so much that we do n't know , '' joye said . bp does n't accept the results of joye 's work . the company said its oil is all accounted for and only exists in two places : within a 2 kilometer area around the wellhead and in tar mats and tar balls that have yet to be cleaned up on the beach . and according to bp 's morrell , the oil and residue that remains is no longer harmful . `` so much time has passed that it no longer has any toxicity and is therefore not a threat to humans or aquatic life , '' morrell said . ocean conservationist philippe cousteau witnessed much of the spill 's aftermath in 2010 , but when he returned to the gulf to dive near an oil rig last month , he was astonished by the abundance of amberjacks , hammerhead sharks and other marine life he saw . during the same trip , however , cousteau spotted a mother dolphin trying to revive a dead calf . it is unknown if its death had anything to do with the oil . cousteau commended the progress community groups and restoration projects have made since the spill , but he said he believes it 's far too early to say the gulf is back and the oil is gone . `` it is still in many cases in the sand , along the shoreline , in the marshes , '' cousteau said , `` and existing on a microscopic scale that we may not be able to see with the naked eye .

      "b\"\\xd3,garissa , kenya -lrb- cnn -rrb- kenyan police have arrested five suspects in connection with thursday 's attack at garissa university college , interior minister joseph nkaissery said friday , according to cnn affiliate ntv . nkaissery told reporters the university will be able to confirm saturday if everyone has been accounted for . thursday 's attack by al-shabaab militants killed 147 people , including 142 students , three security officers and two university security personnel . the attack left 104 people injured , including 19 who are in critical condition , nkaissery said . during search and recovery efforts on friday , cnn witnessed one male who was not a student hiding under a bed . that male was taken into custody and was being treated as a suspect , sources close to the search told cnn . the find sparked an additional search of the building . sources said three people , all students , were found alive . a female student was found under a pile of bodies , another female student was hiding in a wardrobe and a male student was hiding in the bathroom , the sources confirmed to cnn . student hellen titus said she survived by fooling the attackers into thinking she was dead . after gunmen shot fellow students , she smeared their blood onto her body to make it seem she 'd been shot , too , she told cnn on friday at a makeshift center for evacuated students . `` in the time of shooting , '' she said , `` they skipped me . '' most of the victims had been shot from behind , in the back of the head , a medic told cnn . `` they 're facing down , always , '' a worker with st. john 's ambulance service said friday . `` they 're always facing down , and they 're shot in the heads , around the back . '' al-shabaab 's long , bloody legacy with kenya . early thursday , an explosion and gunfire cut through the morning quiet on the campus about 90 miles -lrb- 145 kilometers -rrb- from kenya 's border with somalia , tearing many students in dormitories out of their sleep . `` never heard anything like this , '' journalist dennis okari from cnn affiliate ntv tweeted as he watched smoke rising over a student hostel . al-shabaab gunmen had first stormed a christian prayer service , where they killed some and took others hostage . then they went across campus with them , shooting non-muslims and sparing muslims , a witness said . they headed for the hostels . student japhet mwala lay in her bed . `` we were sleeping when we heard a loud explosion that was followed by gunshots , and everyone started running for safety , '' she told agence france-presse . awaking to terror : ' i am lucky to be alive ' `` there are those who were not able to leave the hostels where the gunmen headed and started firing . i am lucky to be alive because i jumped through the fence with other students , '' she said . students ran -- some crawled -- away from the gunfire , okari said . at one point , the gunmen pinned down a building where 360 students lived , interior minister joseph nkaissery said . okari took cover outside the campus and listened to explosions and gunfire for four hours . kenyan security forces moved in and killed four gunmen . somali terror group al-shabaab , an al qaeda affiliate , claimed responsibility for the attack . the interior ministry has posted a `` most wanted '' notice for a man in connection with it . it offered a reward of 20 million kenyan shillings , about $ 215,000 , for mohamed mohamud , who goes by the aliases dulyadin and gamadhere . the post does not say what role the man may have played . kenyan police are circulating `` wanted dead or alive '' posters featuring eight terror suspects who are wanted in separate attacks in kenya , the interior ministry said . police are offering a bounty of more than $ 210,000 for the suspects , the ministry said via twitter . the dangerously porous border between somalia and kenya has made it easy for al-shabaab militants to cross over and carry out attacks . in a december attack at a quarry , al-shabaab militants separated muslims from others and executed the non-muslims , killing at least 36 people . in november , militants stopped a bus near the border and killed 28 people they believed to be non-muslims . last month , the u.s. embassy warned of possible attacks `` throughout kenya in the near-term '' after the reported death of a key al-shabaab leader , adan garaar , who was suspected in the september 2013 westgate mall attack in nairobi . opinion : a weakened al-shabaab lashes out . police have declared a curfew for the next several days in the region from 6:30 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. . the education ministry has closed the university indefinitely . surviving students have gathered in large groups at the town 's airport , waiting to be flown to their hometowns . the effects are also being felt 225 miles west in kenya 's capital of nairobi , where the new bloodshed reinvigorated an old debate : is the nation 's security strong enough ? many thought measures taken after the westgate mall massacre had filled the gaps . at least 67 people died then . but thursday 's attack is the second-worst in the country 's history , and it has evaporated much of the confidence won after westgate . civil liberty concerns had held up the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits , but on thursday , kenyan president uhuru kenyatta gave a directive to process them . `` kenya badly needs additional officers , '' he said , `` and i will not keep the nation waiting .

      "b\"\\xf2&-lrb- cnn -rrb- sleek chassis , alluring paintwork and a need for speed , but these are no ordinary motors . when pedal hits metal , an eco-friendly process gets set in motion . powered by electricity and engineered for efficiency , car enthusiasts from across africa are sparking home-grown concepts that have gotten experts revving . in zaria , a city in northern nigeria , a team of students from the ahmadu bello university are currently applying the final touches to the `` abucar 2 . '' the students used locally available materials to build the vehicle , and even included recycled electrical components in the engine . while it runs on gasoline , the engine maximizes fuel efficiency and produces fewer emissions than normal cars . `` we are sure we have a great car , '' says the project 's supervisor muhammad dauda . `` now we are focusing on making some final enhancements to hone the driving strategy -- this is just like formula one . '' their compact creation , which was built over five months , will travel to the netherlands in may to compete in the european leg of this year 's shell eco-marathon -- the motoring competition rewards those who travel the longest distance using the least amount of fuel . but the team is also working towards a hybrid petro-electric motor , which they hope to unveil in 2016 . at low speeds the vehicle will be powered by electricity alone , but at higher speeds both electric and petrol components will work together . between extremes , excess power generated by the engine recharges the batteries that power the electric motor . it 's the model that toyota uses in the prius . green-focused designs like these are increasingly needed on the continent , as some studies say 50 % of global emissions of organic carbon could come from africa in 2030 . at may 's shell eco-marathon , abucar 's team will be hoping to race past the sleek `` autonov iii '' creation from the university of lagos . painted the colors of the nigerian flag and powered by a solar battery , the car 's aerodynamic teardrop shape helps minimize drag . constructing earlier iterations of this vehicle was put under stress in 2013 when university teachers went on a six month strike , but the industrial action did n't stop the team from tinkering with the electric engine . `` we 've used small tires to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle , '' explains team manager chukwuemeka isiogu . `` we 've trained ourselves to just think about fuel efficiency and create the most efficient vehicle . '' other eco-friendly engineers are less about sleek and more focused on comfort . uganda 's makerere university has produced a two-seater electric car called `` kiira ev '' . with a super-light fibreglass body and lithium ion battery , the car can go 50 miles on a single charge . the design project cost $ 35,000 , but the engineers made sure to include leather seats and a cd player . whilst working on the kiira , the team is also developing an 28-seater electric bus which will run on a mixture of electric and solar power . innovative creations have also come from the university of benin in nigeria . their `` tuke-tuke '' car -- named after local mini-buses -- is made from locally available materials . the brake pads , for example , are made from palm kernels . tuke-tuke also has some key features that will come in handy when slipping through the city 's streets . windscreen wipers start automatically when rain hits the sensors , gears can be changed with the touch of a button and owners use their finger rather than a key to unlock the doors . and when it gets dark , the driver just needs to clap their hands to turn on the interior lights . elsewhere , engineers are working on green vehicles for the whole family . one ghanaian inventor is building suvs with electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries . apostle safo , who also founded a church , dreams big in his five-seater creations which are hand built in gomoa mpota , except for the headlights and tires . while he says the product will be affordable , it remains to be seen just how much a handmade suv would cost . these innovations certainly are impressive concepts , but it 's unlikely electric vehicles will be filling roads on the continent any time soon -- it is unclear how economically viable it would be for governments and companies to build the right number of charging points , but the issue of power itself is even more pressing . `` reliability when it comes to electricity supply is key , '' says south african sustainability consultant anthony dane . `` convincing consumers across africa to invest in an electric vehicle whilst electricity shortages are such a major issue in so many communities is a challenge .

ashish thakkar : right now in the last 18 years i have been active on the continent , i have never seen so much global excitement around africa that i \\'ve seen today . the climate and the ease of doing business on the continent has drastically improved . unfortunately , it \\'s one of those cases where perception is so different from reality . the reality on the ground is so much better than the perception . you \\'ve got to remember , as africa , we are 54 countries . some of the countries may be challenging and may have issues , but that can not be an excuse to generalize the entire continent which is unfortunately something that happens quite a bit . cnn : why do you think that entrepreneurs are so important to the future growth of the african continent ? at : we have a very young demographic -- 85 % of our populations are under the age of 35 . we have an extremely entrepreneurial society and culture . yet , entrepreneurship is not in the education system . where do our entrepreneurs go for advice and the right guidance ? and it \\'s something , frankly , that i am extremely passionate about , because the answer to unemployment is not foreign direct investment or large scale manufacturing plants , etc. . it \\'s going to be nurturing small and medium enterprises . so , it \\'s great to see that there is a real entrepreneurial vibe coming into the system , and innovation is totally embedded into that . cnn : what is it about africa that encourages innovation ? at : the biggest advantage we have at the moment , and you \\'ve seen this with mobile phone penetration , is that we do n\\'t have legacy systems . we did n\\'t have landlines and we did n\\'t need them . we did n\\'t have to go through that hassle of creating landlines everywhere . we leapfrogged straight into mobile telephony . today , we have over 750 million phones on the continent -- more than north america and western europe put together . we can actually leapfrog in so many different ways . mobile money is another brilliant example . mobile money was created in kenya . the whole concept of having money on your phone , which is the best thing because it \\'s secure , it \\'s practical , made more sense . so , these kind of innovations , you \\'re going to see a lot more of on the continent . i spend a lot of time with young entrepreneurs when i travel across the continent , and just seeing the kind of innovation and new ideas and concepts that they \\'re coming up with is just so inspiring . cnn : what advice would you give to a young entrepreneur who \\'s just starting out ? at : entrepreneurship is a journey , it \\'s not a destination . there are going to be so many challenges , you are going to get knocked down so many times , but you \\'ve got to get up , dust yourself off and get back to it . the persistence , the passion , and staying on course is very crucial . you \\'ll be tempted to cut corners , you \\'ll be tempted to do things that get you there quicker , but it never lasts . people say the youth are the leaders of tomorrow - we \\'re not . we \\'re the leaders of today , but it \\'s our responsibility to take the seat at the table . cnn : what needs to be done most urgently to grow african economies ? at : pan-african collaboration is extremely important . i think things like regional integration , inter-african trade does need to increase and is increasing . i mean , the progress in the east african community has been amazing . the manner in which they \\'ve harmonized so many different laws and policies and mindset and priorities within that region has been fantastic . so , we need to see more of that take place on the continent . the fact that we \\'re 54 countries , yet we \\'re a billion people is an advantage and a disadvantage . i think to strengthen our weakness in that collaboration across the continent is crucial . cnn : are you confident about the future of the continent ? at : i am so bullish and so proud of how the continent has evolved in terms of leadership , the mindset of our leaders . it is so inspiring to see that . it \\'s unfortunate that , you know , globally the highlight remains things like ebola ... the little issues that we do have are just magnified , yet on the broad scale we are doing so amazing . cnn : is this africa \\'s century ? at : mara \\'s logo is the african lion and our little joke , which a lot of people do n\\'t appreciate , hence i love it even more , is that the indian tiger and the chinese dragon have had their days and it \\'s now the african lion \\'s turn . and it genuinely is -- this is our turn . more from marketplace africa . read this : africa \\'s green lean speed machines . read this : family ties mixed with fresh fruit on island paradise . editor \\'s note : cnn marketplace africa covers the macro trends impacting the region and also focuses on the continent \\'s key industries and corporations .\"\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

      "b\"\\x9a3-lrb- cnn -rrb- well , the thought experiments are finally over . hillary clinton 's online declaration for president means the focus will now shift to the campaign and to what kind of president she might be . and nowhere will the speculation be greater than in the area of foreign policy , certain to be a major issue in the upcoming campaign . should she win , clinton will add to her potential `` firsts '' : first woman president ; the first president who had been a first lady . there 's another one , too : the first secretary of state to become president since james buchanan . only a handful of the nation 's top diplomats have gone to the white house -lrb- thomas jefferson ; james madison ; james monroe ; john quincy adams ; martin van buren ; and buchanan -rrb- . and none in the 20th century , a curious fact that suggests politics and statecraft are quite different animals . too few of our secretaries of state have had the necessary experience of elected office or the desire , ambition and temperament to compete for the top job . still , on balance , clinton 's tenure at the state department should be a real advantage during the campaign , particularly when compared with the absence of foreign policy experience among her prospective republican rivals . but this will be no cake walk for her on the foreign policy side . clinton will have to negotiate and traverse several tricky and rocky paths to ensure that her state department career remains an advantage and does n't turn into a liability . here 's why : . the last president to serve in a top job in the administration of his immediate predecessor was george h.w. bush . circumstances were different then . far from wanting to distance himself from reagan , bush 41 saw merit in reinforcing the association with a president who dominated his day in a way few chief executives have . clinton will face a harder balancing act : how to stand by the policies that she helped craft in obama 's first term and still separate herself from an administration her opponents will blast as weak , vacillating and fairly or not , responsible for a world that is seen to be much worse , especially in the middle east and with russia , than when president obama took office . in the process , she 'll have to define her own approach to the world . indeed , given the president 's vulnerabilities on foreign policy , she ca n't afford to be seen as obama 's third term . in her memoir `` hard choices , '' she 's already laid the foundation for distancing herself from obama on issues such as doing more for the syrian opposition and being tougher on russia 's vladimir putin . and she can legitimately work to sharpen those differences without seeming to walk away from policies she supported and leaving herself open to charges that she has no principles , only politically expedient tactics . too much loyalty to a president who is unpopular among independents will hurt her . but so will flip-flopping . nowhere will her challenges be greater than on iran . clinton presided over the secret channel that laid the basis for the november 2013 interim accord and led directly to the putative understandings reached between the united states and iran earlier this month in lausanne , switzerland . and she certainly can take credit for pushing tough sanctions that forced iran to the table . the problem , of course , is that her republican opponents and more than a few democrats hate what the negotiations have produced . much less enamored with the obama 's `` let 's engage our enemies '' trope , clinton may have doubts herself . the good news is that there wo n't be an agreement for months . so for now , she can back the importance of tough negotiating and even tougher sanctions or worse , should the iranians cheat . but sooner or later , perhaps as early as june if there 's an agreement , clinton will have to take a stand on what may well be a very problematic and unpopular accord and what congress ' role should be . her opponents , the israelis , and much of the organized jewish community , will portray it as even worse , and that is likely to be somewhat problematic and will be hyped as even worse . and this will put her at odds with traditional friends and supporters in the jewish community . frankly given her political interests , it would be easier for her candidacy if the agreement fell apart and she could campaign on a tough anti-iranian message , hammering the mullahs ' repressive policies at home and their mischief-making in the region . she may not be that lucky . still she will have an advantage in dealing with the pro-israeli community . unlike president obama , the clintons have strong credentials on the israeli issue . and that will help somewhat in trying to walk a narrow line between a negotiating process with iran that clinton launched and its fruits , which are seen by many israelis and american jews right now as too generous to the mullahs . clinton 's time at the state department should help her in a presidential campaign where americans are looking for strong and prudent leadership in foreign policy and more adult supervision in the white house . the republicans will try and show that benghazi and the email controversy have tarnished her image as secretary and claim she did n't accomplish much . clinton was n't a henry kissinger or a james baker . but given the problems she confronted -- iran , stalled israeli-palestinian two-state negotiations -lrb- none ready for any kind of solution or breakthrough -rrb- and a president who dominated rather than delegated foreign policy , she performed ably enough . she improved the nation 's image and pushed 21st century issues such as women 's rights , youth , and the environment . her critics will dismiss all this as a kind of naive planetary humanism . still , four years as secretary of state will help her project the kind of confidence and competence that will appear to many as an important credential to lead america in a dangerous and turbulent world . and in a presidential campaign where none of her opponents has her long experience in international affairs , that can only help . clinton 's biggest challenge on the campaign trail and in office should she win is whether she can develop a foreign policy vision and an effective approach to the world that strikes a better balance between the risk-readiness of george w. bush and the risk-aversion of barack obama . and given the cruel and unforgiving nature of the world america now inhabits , this will be no easy task .Q\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' for koreans , drinking is considered a way to get to know what someone is really like . `` i did n't really like it in the beginning , '' says charles lee , a korean-canadian who came to seoul to work for a south korean company . `` i was like , ` why are you making me drink something when i do n't want to ? ' but once i understood the meaning behind it , i appreciated it more . `` there are just some things you ca n't say at work or talk about over lunch -- people who talk about work at lunch are losers . but when someone offers you a glass of soju , it 's an invitation that means that they want to listen to you . `` i thought koreans were impersonal before i drank with them , so the whole context is important . '' drinking is such a big part of korean life that seoul traffic is said to correspond with the city 's drinking culture . mondays are a big night for hoesik , so there are fewer cars during evening rush hour , as most office workers leave them at work so they can go drinking . tuesdays are a rest day , while wednesday and thursday nights are also big nights for company drinking . fridays have the worst evening traffic , as everyone is taking their cars home to use with their families over the weekend . so how do you avoid offending someone -lrb- worst of all , a superior or client -rrb- at a korean drinking extravaganza ? follow these seven handy rules . koreans always identify the `` higher '' person in the relationship , and defer to them accordingly . one of the first things koreans often ask when meeting someone new is their age . even someone just a year older is afforded a language of respect , though age is always superseded by a higher position . it 's considered rude for anyone to have an empty glass . if a senior person is pouring -- this usually pertains to hard liquor only -- others should n't drink until someone has poured the senior a shot . after all glasses are full , everyone says `` gunbae ! '' and chugs -- usually `` one-shotting '' the entire glass in one go . while downing alcohol , you should turn your body away from senior figures so that your body visually blocks your drinking action from your senior . always hold bottles or shot glasses with both hands . by raising your glass or pouring alcohol with one hand , you are establishing yourself as a senior person . if you 're not , well , you 've just breached protocol . it 's always a good idea to find out people 's drinking habits beforehand . it should n't be difficult to find out what people like to drink or how they behave when intoxicated . hoesik usually involves changing venues for a different type of alcohol -- i.e. , round one is dinner , accompanied by beer , round two is soju , round three is for whiskey , and so on . be ready for each . unless you have an airtight reason , refusing alcohol is considered a mood killer and deemed rude . sorry , but `` i do n't like soju '' does n't qualify as a good reason not to punish your liver . neither would `` i 've been on the wagon for three years . '' in fact , unless you 're pregnant or already puking , what might be a `` good reason '' not to imbibe elsewhere often wo n't fly here . it 's generally best to accept and discreetly get rid of unwanted alcohol -lrb- under the table , into your water cup , out the window -rrb- than to refuse it . one of the most popular venues in korea for business drinking is the karaoke bar . koreans love singing , as evidenced by the country 's staggering number of karaoke bars , as well as the rush of audition programs on korean television . your companions wo n't rest until you sing . they 'll coax , threaten , push and cajole until you finally take that mic . be prepared to crack under the immense peer pressure . if you simply can not take any more , you can call a black knight -lrb- male -rrb- or a black rose -lrb- female -rrb- to your rescue . this entails a person of your choosing drinking your glass for you , but it also means they get a wish . as in , you might soon wish you 'd just taken that last shot as you 're spelling your name out with your butt in front of your client . bottoms up . christopher cha is a korean-american writer based in seoul .$\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe83-lrb- cnn -rrb- here 's a pop quiz : what 's better for america 's status in the world ? a -rrb- being a global leader in innovation , job creation , education , social mobility , literacy and child health . b -rrb- being a global leader in imprisoning the highest number of human beings -- its own citizens . it 's an obvious answer . but the unfortunate reality is that the united states leads the world in incarceration , not education . our country has shown time and again a nearly unlimited capacity to reinvent itself and move closer to the ideals on which our society was founded . yet we have emerged as the global leader in a race that no nation would want to even be a contender in . while our country is home to only 5 % of the world 's total population , we are home to 25 % of the world 's prison population . and nearly three fourths of this population is comprised of nonviolent offenders . at the same time , we are losing the increasingly important race to educate our citizens . where the united states was once ranked first in high school graduation rates , we now rank 23rd in high school completion among 30 of the world 's most developed nations . where we were once the driving force of the global economy , we now rank fifth in the world economic forum 's global competitiveness index . key metrics in this index include the quality of a nation 's primary , secondary and higher education systems . instead of empowering the next generation of american artists , scientists , engineers , inventors and entrepreneurs , our country has chosen to devote a massive amount of resources , time and energy to locking people up . by imprisoning individuals , we also burden families , condemn generations to cycles of poverty and breed economic inequality . in the 1980s and 1990s , congress chose to adopt laws that drastically changed the way our country handled nonviolent drug crimes . since then , the american prison population has increased by nearly 800 % over the past 30 years . over 2.7 million american children have a parent who is incarcerated , and 10 million american children at one time in their lives had a parent in prison . americans of color are disproportionately burdened by the failures of our justice system . there are more black men in prison or under state or federal supervision today than there were enslaved in 1850 . and while african americans make up only 13.6 % of the total u.s. population , they make up a whopping 40.2 % of the u.s. prison population . the sad reality is that in today 's america , prisoners are never truly free from the burdens of our criminal justice system . a report from the center for economic and policy research concluded that once released from prison , an ex-offender 's prospects for obtaining employment statistically decreased . the report estimated that , in 2008 , ex-offender employment losses cost our economy the equivalent of 1.5 to 1.7 million workers , or $ 57 billion to $ 65 billion annually . it 's therefore no surprise that american prisons have become revolving doors , with two out of every three former offenders rearrested within three years of their release . the millions of wives , sisters , husbands , daughters , sons , friends and the people they love who have been incarcerated are burdened disproportionately by an outdated , archaic and overly punitive system . these millions of americans have the ability to advance our country , our economy and our global competitiveness . they just need to be given the opportunity . american taxpayers are n't free from the burdens of our criminal justice system either . in addition to the billions lost in jobs and productivity , americans spend over a quarter of a trillion dollars each year to keep millions of nonviolent , low-level offenders imprisoned . the price tag is truly staggering . it costs on average $ 29,000 a year to house one inmate at the federal level . in contrast , our country spends a little over $ 11,000 dollars a year per elementary school student . imagine the good we could do if we could re-appropriate those tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer money and economic losses away from imprisonment and toward investment in our children 's future . we must start to deconstruct the perverse order of our priorities and build a more just society by making needed changes at the federal level . we must examine the way our criminal justice system works -- or rather , does n't -- and take the necessary actions to change it . fortunately , there is already a road map for successfully addressing these problems . we know reforms will work because they already are in states across the country . in both blue states such as new jersey and connecticut and red states such as texas and georgia , state and local officials have developed and instituted sweeping reforms that have reduced their prison populations and crime rates . they are succeeding by focusing their efforts on areas where the criminal justice system most needs reform . we should follow their example on the federal level . first , we should pass legislation that promotes `` front end '' reform , such as ending mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent drug crimes . secondly , we should pass legislation that enacts `` behind the wall '' reforms , such as eradicating the cruel practice of juvenile solitary confinement . and thirdly , we should enact `` back end '' reforms with legislation that assists in sealing criminal records and removing barriers to employment for nonviolent formerly incarcerated people . as we reform our criminal justice system at the national level , we will alter the cycles of poverty and recidivism that plague too many american communities and start to develop virtuous cycles of excellence . instead of putting resources toward juvenile detention centers , we can put resources toward afterschool programs that have proved to help keep kids out of the juvenile justice system and in school . instead of losing valuable contributors to our economy because of their status as ex-offenders , we can develop apprenticeship and training programs that improve worker skills and jump start our economy . instead of asking american taxpayers to pay for warehousing people who commit nonviolent , low-level , crimes , we can make sure that students of all ages have access to math , science and technology schooling that will help them excel in the workforce and as productive members of society . let 's devote our resources to empowering our citizens , not imprisoning them . let 's choose to raise our expectations as a country , and let 's meet them .\\xfc\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf2--lrb- cnn -rrb- this week , hillary clinton surprised the world yet again -- not with the official launch of her campaign but for the unconventional way she did it . she sure pushed the envelope . with her video , new logo and road trip , she opened a long communications campaign not only to `` rebrand '' herself but to completely reframe who she is , what she stands for and how she intends to run . we 'll find out over the next year and a half whether it will work . many in the press and on late-night television scratched their heads this week ; others were scathing . ruth marcus -- a columnist for the washington post -- dismissed her launch video as a `` relentlessly , insultingly vapid '' effort of `` demographic box-checking . '' jon stewart lampooned it as a `` state farm commercial gone viral '' and also `` boring as s -- . '' since the media will likely be the stand-in primary opponent for hillary , their belief in her authenticity is a critical factor in whether she can reframe herself in voter 's eyes . but from a marketing perspective , her launch may have been much more successful than critics think . the youtube announcement video took on the central strategic challenge for the campaign and candidate : to flip clinton 's message from self-absorbed `` i '' to empathetic `` we . '' while critics may sneer , it is hard to deny that the image it projects of hillary is more confident , fresher , simpler and forward-looking , with even a bit of the upstart feel of two of the most successful product launch companies , nike and apple . clinton 's team may have begun to create an empathetic relationship with voters that has eluded her in the past , most crucially when she lost the nomination fight to barack obama in 2008 . in marketing terms , rebranding is a strategy to bring a new name , term , symbol or design to an established brand with the aim of developing a new identity in the minds of consumers . reframing is a strategy that goes further : it seeks to change how a consumer -lrb- or voter -rrb- emotionally experiences an established brand . a rebrand may change how you think about a brand ; a reframe may change how you feel about it . in the apple case , the company at one time fell on its face when it unveiled the original macintosh ; some thought the company was headed for oblivion . but when steve jobs returned as ceo , he went back to the drawing board and soon unveiled the ipod , which not only changed the way consumers thought about apple , but how they experienced it . not only a rebrand -- but a reframe . take hillary 's road trip to iowa in the van nicknamed scooby . the press lampooned her , but i would bet that for many others , her unscripted and anonymous stop at chipotle reinforced the `` everyday americans '' campaign theme . hillary stood in line to order , an everyday customer among everyday people at an everyday fast-food chain . also introduced last week was what will come to be the single most-ubiquitous element of her campaign : clinton 's new and controversial campaign logo . it is a brilliant , iconic expression of the emotional connection she wants people to have with her , her message and her movement . in fact , her logo is all about movement . simple , confident , high tech and shorthand to a much younger set of voters , the bold red arrow moving left to right in front of the strong blue h says it all : you are the important ones . i 'm here to support you with everything i 've got . let me help you move forward . taken together , all the pieces of clinton 's announcement -- as well as the unconventional media she used to deliver them -- bring her back on stage not as a leader from yesterday but , surprisingly , as one for the future . coincidentally , the way marco rubio announced his run for the republican nomination most likely amplified the impact of clinton 's reframing . for all his posturing about being the new generation , rubio followed to a `` t '' the most traditional script for announcing a candidacy : traditional stage and podium , dark suit , bright tie , wife and kids on camera , a live speech , all about himself , timed for the evening news . rubio 's logo , the signature of his image , drew immediate criticism for being amateurish and unconsidered , even leaving alaska and hawaii off the map of america . in stark contrast , hillary showed the confidence and finesse to buck tradition on every front . it was hillary who pulled the ultimate jiu-jitsu . there are those , of course , who will be alienated , if not disgusted , by the way her campaign has unfurled such a sophisticated marketing plan . in a day when voters are yearning for authenticity , how do we know this is the real hillary or a candidate in a mask ? fair question . but for better or worse , mass marketing has become the staple of presidential campaigns -- that 's where most campaign dollars go . both sides know how to play , sometimes brilliantly . remember the reagan advertisements of 1984 , proclaiming `` morning in america '' ? what we know is that over time , voters see a lot of unscripted moments of a candidate where the real character comes through . and if they spot hypocrisy between ads and the candidate , that campaign will get into trouble fast . that 's why the key to hillary clinton 's success in reframing her message and movement will be consistency . she must not only take the essence of a humble , empathic relationship with voters and integrate it into all elements of her communication , she must also live it every day . otherwise there will be messaging `` schizophrenia , '' the solid start with flashes of brilliance will peter out and she 'll be facing the same voter perceptions that doomed her race in 2008 . in the meantime , one can imagine clinton getting a huge , satisfying belly laugh out of the early returns on her efforts .\\xbe\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' for climate change `` next year '' is now . this year is the time and the united nations ' international climate negotiations in paris in december are the place to secure strong global agreement to curb heat-trapping emissions . a successful climate pact will send a signal around the world that a shift to a low-carbon economy is underway . the united states has made clear that it is ready to step up to the plate on climate change . the u.s. administration on tuesday unveiled details about its proposal to reduce u.s. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 % to 28 % below 2005 levels by 2025 . this common-sense and achievable plan to decarbonize the u.s. economy will result in significant cost savings from cleaner technologies and create more american energy jobs to power our homes and businesses . this is an area where the united states needs to lead , and doing so will create a better planet for our children and a more prosperous future for our country . the united states is n't alone in this global climate effort . in a landmark joint announcement with the united states in november , china unveiled its intent to peak its carbon emissions around 2030 and to double its share of zero-carbon energy to 20 % . this shift will require substantial effort from china to retool its economy , increase investment in renewable energy and divest from coal . as the world 's no. 1 investor in renewable energy , china has already taken important steps forward . at the same time , india has set the audacious goal of installing 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity by 2022 , a 30-fold increase from current levels and eight times more solar capacity than the united states has today . cities and corporations are joining in as well . more than 200 cities , home to 436 million people , have voluntarily committed to saving 13 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions by midcentury . and more than a thousand companies , along with 73 countries , voiced support for putting a price on carbon and moving to cleaner energy technologies . leading companies , like apple and google , are making major bets on renewable energy . and another 25 businesses have signed onto the corporate renewable energy buyers ' principles -- these companies represent energy demand equal to more than 1 million homes . increasing examples demonstrate that strong climate action can be good for the economy . for instance , renewable sources now provide one-fifth of the world 's electricity , while solar manufacturing costs have dropped 80 % in the last seven years . wind turbines installed now are 100 times better at generating power than turbines were 30 years ago . clean technology investments surged to $ 310 billion last year . in the united states , carbon emissions fell by 10 % from 2007 to 2013 , the largest absolute emissions reduction recorded , even as the united states has recovered from the great recession . many of these shifts are unprecedented and could not have been anticipated even five years ago . yet these trends alone are not enough to counter the mounting climate-related impacts that we are already seeing . a global climate agreement in paris this december can send more signals to markets and drive more ambitious climate action for decades to come . a paris agreement would represent a new form of international cooperation and a fundamental change in the global approach to climate action -- a shift from burden-sharing to the creation of mutual opportunities ; from cost to investment ; from economic threat to a spur to economic development . with the united states showing the way , and with cooperation from other countries , businesses , investors , cities and citizens , we can achieve a prosperous and secure future for all . each year , baseball returns and hope springs eternal . now , it 's time for all countries to get in the game .`\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x98\\x18-lrb- cnn -rrb- every morning , sissa abu dahou puts on traditional male dress , known as a jalabiya , and heads into the streets of the egyptian city of luxor for a day of hard work . but this man of the house is actually a woman . the grandmother of two has dressed as a man for 43 years to avoid oppression and eek out a living in the conservative muslim state . `` why did you do this mother ? '' her daughter asked during a recorded interview with egyptian television network cbc . `` your father died and i was six months pregnant with you . '' she replied . `` none of my siblings helped me . i raised you and sent you to school . without money i could not have gotten you an education . '' a widow at just 21 , dahou was forced to fend for herself in egypt 's patriarchal south , where decades ago it was unheard of for women to earn their own living . even in recent years , women make up barely 24 % of egypt 's workforce , according to the world bank . `` it is considered wrong that i dressed as a man but no one can judge . not you or anyone else . only god can judge me , '' dahou said , `` people talked but i said i decided to be a man so i can take care of my small daughter . '' the breadwinner worked as a brick maker for just 25 piasters , the equivalent of a few cents , until she saved up enough money to buy a shoeshine kit . she found a place for her wooden box , painted with red hearts and the egyptian flag , alongside the all-male shoe shiners of her community . `` if it was n't for my mother , i would have been on the streets '' houda , her daughter , told tv host mona al-shazly through tears . `` honestly i would have been in the streets . i did not find a home except with my mother . and even today my children rely on her . '' the years of sun and sand weathered and darkened dahou 's face and left her with a voice so deep and raspy she can easily be mistaken for a man . her only child , houda , eventually married and had two children of her own . through the years the one-time housewife dreamed of owning her own business one day , a small street stand to sell snacks and cigarettes . after her interview on cbc television , the governor of luxor province offered dahou a kiosk and a cash advance . the maverick had one requirement - she would only agree to meet with the governor in male attire . `` even if i die , i will not take it off , '' dahou said as she pulled on the male jalabiya in front of a tv camera , `` when i had to dress in a woman 's jalabiya when i went to cairo i felt suffocated . no , i thank god . i do n't want anyone to look at me or look at my daughter . '' now the 65-year-old who earned respect as a man has gained praise as a woman . egypt 's president , abdel fattah el-sisi , crowned her as one of egypt 's ideal mothers in an official ceremony last month . `` if i was really a man , i would not have done this , '' dahou told her daughter , `` i would have gotten remarried . i would have left you who knows where . you would have been treated without dignity or left homeless . thank god i was able to protect you .

      "b\"\\xbd'-lrb- cnn -rrb- in case you needed a reminder that president barack obama is n't running for office again , he just alienated not only republicans , who have largely resented him from day one , but the progressive base of democratic voters . obama has argued with the progressive potentate elizabeth warren , calling her `` wrong '' on trade policy . the massachusetts senator is the same potentate to whom hillary clinton has been religiously prostrating . what everyone does next will be critical for the 2016 elections and the future of democratic politics . warren has publicly criticized so-called `` fast track '' trade authority that would allow the white house to negotiate massive , multination trade deals with little congressional oversight . the authority would pave the way for trade pacts such as the trans-pacific partnership , which is modeled on the north american free trade agreement , and has killed 700,000 american jobs and drove wages down in the united states while simultaneously decimating mexican agriculture and small businesses . aspects of the tpp deal would provide incentives for off-shoring jobs to low-wage countries , imposing limits on government regulations around food safety and the environment , and create mechanisms for multinational corporations to challenge any domestic laws they simply do n't like . in december , warren wrote a letter signed by several other democrats to u.s. trade representative michael froman raising concerns about the tpp . the letter warned that the tpp could erode safeguards that have been put in place to `` prevent future financial crises . '' `` we can not afford a trade deal that undermines the government 's ability to protect the american economy , '' warren wrote . at a town hall with msnbc 's chris matthews on tuesday , president obama said , `` i love elizabeth . we 're allies on a whole host of issues . but she 's wrong on this . '' obama added , `` when you hear folks make a lot of suggestions about how bad this trade deal is , when you dig into the facts , they are wrong . '' but `` i 'm right and she 's wrong '' does n't exactly come off as a thoughtful , let alone respectful , response to the policy critiques of one of the most trusted economic justice leaders in the democratic party today . meanwhile , hillary clinton is trying to walk a fine line somewhere in the middle . clinton has recently courted warren 's support while forcefully repeating the rhetoric of populism . but according to a report by the new york times , clinton 's staff is at pains to suggest that clinton has always been a populist as opposed to merely trying to now co-opt a current trend . yet it becomes harder to paint clinton as the `` original elizabeth warren '' each time she equivocates on trade policy and the tpp . in a 2012 speech as secretary of state , clinton praised the tpp as `` the gold standard in trade agreements to open free , transparent , fair trade , the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field . '' but now , as she campaigns for president facing a democratic electorate divided over the deal , clinton is sounding more critical . `` any trade deal has to produce jobs and raise wages and increase prosperity and protect our security , '' clinton said this week . so does clinton support the tpp deal or not ? campaigning in new hampshire on tuesday , clinton reportedly declined to say one way or the other . that 's not the behavior of a fierce populist . it 's more indicative of the sort of politically calculated , ideologically centrist `` triangulation '' for which her husband was famous . seizing on clinton 's ambiguity , her potential challenger in the democratic primary , martin o'malley , released a video this week making clear that he is against the tpp . according to a poll , as of 2012 just 1 in 4 americans believed that nafta had benefited u.s. workers and only 1 in 3 believed it had benefited the u.s. economy overall . even most republicans in this poll supported the position that the united states should either `` renegotiate '' or `` leave '' nafta versus `` continue to be a member . '' in other words , any political leader with even the dimmest grasp of economics let alone political pragmatism should run away from a new trade deal modeled on imitating and expanding nafta . while it 's not surprising that republicans are siding with big business and against working americans in supporting the tpp , it 's befuddling that president obama supports it . the only hope now is for 2016 democratic candidates , especially clinton at this point , to support populism not just in rhetoric but in real policy terms and show which party is , for the most part , on the side of the people and not on the side of multinational corporations . senate majority leader harry reid minced no words in revealing his position about trade `` fast track '' authority : `` i 'm not only no , i 'm hell no . '' if hillary clinton wants to prove she 's a real populist , now 's her chance to be even more clear .$\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb0)-lrb- cnn -rrb- so now the real trial is underway : what does the surviving boston marathon bomber , dzhokhar tsarnaev , deserve and why ? what 's he likely to get and why ? let 's start where the penalty phase starts , with the prosecution 's case . prosecutors have listed , as they must , the aggravating circumstances that make this horrific mass murderer deserve the harshest punishment . the killing was `` heinous , cruel and depraved . '' he placed a bomb in a crowd , set it to kill and maim children and adults indiscriminately -- if that 's not heinous , cruel and depraved , what is ? cruelty classically consists of a desire to cause pain and suffering in innocent victims , or , at the opposite extreme , it reflects a cold , callous indifference . tsarnaev displayed both . cruelty really provides us a lens into the worst of the worst of the worst . the number of dead from the bombing -lrb- three -rrb- and injured -lrb- 260 -rrb- , including dozens maimed , also elevate these murders . the victims were vulnerable -- no one more so than 8-year-old martin richard . for 2,500 years , we have proclaimed that all human beings are equally valuable , yet we identify certain victims as especially worthy , and those who prey on them as especially culpable . the prosecution 's emphasis : the killings involved `` substantial planning and premeditation '' and a betrayal of the united states -- the very country that gave tsarnaev shelter and citizenship . and then there 's the selection of the site , the boston marathon , an `` iconic '' event . and then there 's tsarnaev 's lack of remorse -- opening day , the prosecutor 's final shot of tsarnaev locked up , giving the security camera the finger . from his blood-scrawled justification in the boat after the bombing to this day , the message has been : screw you , society . tsarnaev may take the stand to beg for mercy , but only if he now feels or at least can fake remorse . and do n't confuse regret with remorse . no doubt tsarnaev regrets his present predicament , regrets the negative publicity he 's brought his friends and family and most poignantly regrets running over and killing his older brother while trying to escape . but that 's a far cry from genuine remorse for the victims he 's killed and maimed . dzhokhar tsarnaev was the lesser of two evils , the defense will insist over and over . tamerlan was the source of his younger brother 's malicious intent . as the prisoners inside washington d.c. 's now defunct lorton central prison once described the street code to me : no snitching , but if someone dies , then `` the dead guy did everything . '' so the defense will claim that dzhokhar was not fully responsible because he could not be . after all , he was only 19 . biologists teach us our brains do n't fully develop until we 're 25 . thus , their argument goes , a 19-year-old simply ca n't be the worst of the worst . in 2005 , the u.s. supreme court struck down the death penalty for those younger than 18 when they killed , repeatedly quoting an article by psychologists laurence steinberg and elizabeth scott . but in the same article , these leading developmental psychologists themselves characterized it as an `` open question whether under real-world conditions the decision making of mid-adolescents is truly comparable with that of adults . '' and they were talking about 17-year-olds . to the best of my knowledge , science has not and can not establish a definitive connection between organic brain development and moral responsibility . think about it : when a 19-year-old bravely dashes into a burning building , risking his life to save children inside , we celebrate this heroism . we do not , nor should we , dismiss this bravery as the product of an impulsive not-yet-fully-formed personality . if we can fully celebrate good character and heroic acts of our best young adults , why ca n't we fully condemn the cowardly viciousness of our worst ? what outcome would i predict in the tsarnaev case ? confronted by surviving victims and images of their dead loved ones , hearing offsetting pleas to `` move on , '' balancing the real suffering in the courtroom against the imagined punishment of life that awaits tsarnaev , i expect the jury will vote 10-2 -lrb- or 9-3 -rrb- for death . but they must be unanimous for death ; a lopsided but divided jury would result in a life sentence . worse , the historical record and headlines in the next day 's anti-death penalty news organizations will probably proclaim : `` jury chooses life for the marathon bomber '' -- even if overwhelmingly the people 's representatives were to vote for death as the more appropriate punishment . requiring a unanimous verdict for death gives the defense an enormous advantage -- one of many . why ? because in the end , we would much prefer that 1 or 10 or 20 convicted murderers who deserve to die instead live out their lives in the relatively nonpunitive condition of prison than one person who deserves to live be wrongly killed at the hands of the people . and yet , if we really commit ourselves to having the punishment fit the crime , if we rightly reserve the death penalty for the most heinous crimes and criminals , surely the boston marathon bomber stands among the worst of the worst .\\xba\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the days were long and tedious . now it was over . `` it 's been an incredibly emotional toll on all of us , '' lesa strachan told cnn 's anderson cooper thursday in the first nationally televised interview with members of the jury . a day earlier , strachan , the jury foreperson , announced the first-degree murder conviction in the 2013 shooting death of hernandez 's onetime friend odin lloyd . strachan said she was struck by the viciousness of multiple gunshots . `` you shot him once but you kept going and you shot him six times . there 's no need for that and there 's no need to use a gun . period . '' before the trial , at least one juror -- rosalie oliver -- had n't heard of the 25-year-old defendant who has now gone from a $ 40 million pro-football contract to a term of life without parole in a maximum-security prison . but kelly dorsey watches the patriots every sunday during the football season . she said so on her jury questionnaire . `` i knew of him as a football player , not a person , '' she said . it did n't affect her vote to convict , she said . it did n't matter that he was a football player , she said . nor did it matter whether he actually pulled the trigger in the murder . `` to leave your friend on the ground , knowing that he 's not there anymore -- he 's either dead or he 's going to die -- that 's indifference , '' dorsey said of hernandez . `` he did n't need to pull the trigger . '' that word -- `` indifference '' -- was used multiple times by members of the jury . jon carlson said he was struck by testimony and video evidence that hernandez and two co-defendants were sunbathing poolside hours after the slaying , drinking smoothies . hernandez at times left his then-8-month-old daughter with the two men . that indifference `` surprised a lot of us , '' carlson said . he stressed the fact that hernandez played football for a living did n't influence the jury 's decision . `` it does n't matter how much money you have or how much money you make . we 're all people , and we 're all equal , and we all deserve the same fair trial , and that 's what we wanted to make sure we gave him , '' carlson said . lloyd was seen june 17 , 2013 , around 2:30 a.m. with hernandez and hernandez 's friends , carlos ortiz and ernest wallace , in a rented silver nissan altima . later that day , a jogger found his body . he had been shot six times , according to prosecutors . wallace and ortiz , who were also charged with murder , have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately . what 's next for aaron hernandez ? rosalie oliver -- the juror who had n't heard of hernandez before the trial -- said that , for her , the first shot was enough . `` there was no need for the other five , '' she said . `` one shot for me is cruelty . '' oliver and other jurors said they were surprised to receive calls from friends congratulating them after the verdict . `` who won ? '' she asked `` odin lloyd did n't win . -lrb- his mother -rrb- did n't bring back her son . did mr. hernandez win ? no , because he 's going to serve the rest of his life in jail and he 's 25 years old . the worst part for me is : how about that little girl that 's never going to see her father again ? '' what prison life will be like for aaron hernandez . oliver recalled making eye contact with hernandez at one point during the months-long trial . `` he actually nodded to me one time , '' she said . `` you come in that room every day and you see this person and it 's hard to come to that decision at the end because -- like three months with them -- it 's almost like they 're part of you . and then , all of a sudden now , you 've got to make that decision to either put him away or let him go . '' the jurors declined to talk about the dynamics inside the jury room , choosing instead to keep the focus on the evidence presented during trial . they conveyed a sense of gravity about their task . `` you see , you know , ` law & order ' and all these different tv shows and it 's just nothing like that at all . it 's just very serious , '' carlson said . 5 things to know about the jury .\\x91&\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x8bK-lrb- cnn -rrb- warren weinstein , who appears to have been the only american citizen held hostage by al qaeda , was accidentally killed in a u.s. drone strike in january . but it did n't have to be that way . a senior u.s. official familiar with the handling of the issue told cnn that the u.s. government made no serious effort to negotiate for the 73-year-old development expert 's release , either directly to al qaeda or through proxies in pakistan . another senior u.s. official told cnn that weinstein 's capture by al qaeda made it hard for the united states to negotiate , even though proxies such as the pakistani government have links to intermediaries who might have helped . a senior pakistani official told cnn that after weinstein was kidnapped , the pakistani government put out feelers to members of the militant haqqani network and to the pakistani taliban , which are both allied to al qaeda , to see if these groups might be able to initiate some kind of negotiation about weinstein . according to the official , nothing came of those feelers . the senior pakistani official says that during the past year pakistani soldiers , who were part of a military offensive in the tribal area of north waziristan near the afghan-pakistan border where weinstein was believed to be being held , went door-to-door looking for the american . nothing came of this search either . on thursday , the u.s. government announced that weinstein had been killed in a `` counterterrorism operation '' in january , which is how the government often describes cia drone strikes . according to new america , which tracks drone strikes in pakistan , cia drone attacks happened in shawal , north waziristan , on january 19 in which at least four militants were killed ; also on january 15 in tehsil ladha , south waziristan , in which at least five militants were killed ; and on january 4 in datta khel , south waziristan , in which at least eight militants were killed . it is in one of these strikes that weinstein was almost certainly killed . lt. col. jason amerine , a planner on the u.s. army staff , is under investigation over a purported unauthorized disclosure to u.s. rep. duncan hunter 's office , which has demonstrated a strong interest in the fate of american hostages held by al qaeda and the taliban . a plan was developed in the pentagon to secure the release of weinstein , according to a staff member on hunter 's committee . that plan was to release haji bashir noorzai , a prominent and influential member of the taliban who is in prison in the states on drug trafficking charges , in exchange for u.s. army sgt. bowe berghdal , who was held by the taliban until last year ; taliban hostages caitlin coleman , a u.s. citizen , and her husband , canadian joshua boyle ; and dr. shakil afridi , who spied for the cia in pakistan and was being held in a pakistani prison , as well as weinstein . it 's not clear how far this plan of action went . amerine is invoking whistleblower protection and denies making an unauthorized disclosure . hunter , a california republican , released a statement thursday , saying , `` the only government organization seriously developing options to recover weinstein and others in the afghanistan/pakistan region was within the pentagon -- led by war hero jason amerine . '' as an army captain , amerine led a small detachment of u.s. special forces into afghanistan in november 2001 in the wake of the september 11 attacks on the united states . the operation was instrumental in helping to topple the taliban and to install hamid karzai as the new leader of afghanistan . who exactly carried out weinstein 's kidnapping from his house 3 1/2 years ago in the pakistani megacity of lahore has until now not been clear . a senior pakistani counterterrorism official told cnn that members of the islamic movement of uzbekistan , or imu , kidnapped weinstein at his lahore home on august 13 , 2011 . imu is an uzbek terrorist group headquartered in the tribal regions of pakistan along its border with afghanistan . according to the pakistani official , the leader of the weinstein kidnapping cell was a relative of tahir yuldashev , the former imu leader killed in a cia drone strike in the pakistani tribal regions in 2009 . the initial lead that traced the weinstein kidnapping to the imu came from another high-profile kidnapping in pakistan two weeks after weinstein 's abduction . shahbaz taseer , the son of a leading pakistani liberal politician salman taseer -- who was killed by pakistani militants eight months earlier -- was kidnapped in lahore on august 26 , 2011 . at the scene of taseer 's kidnapping one of the kidnappers dropped a cell phone and sim card that eventually led pakistani officials to focus on the imu group in lahore , according to the senior pakistani counterterrorism official . the police subsequently arrested three uzbeks and four pakistanis who were part of the imu cell that had carried out the weinstein kidnapping . members of the imu cell told pakistani interrogators that after they had kidnapped weinstein they moved him while he was tranquilized and semi-conscious among three safe houses in lahore . imu members then took weinstein to the federally administered tribal areas in pakistan , a semi-autonomous region along the border with afghanistan where al qaeda and other militant groups are headquartered . there weinstein was given or , more likely , sold to al qaeda , according to the senior pakistani official . who was warren weinstein ? weinstein had spent his life helping others , working in the fields of aid and development . he held a doctorate in international law and economics from columbia university and spoke more than half a dozen languages . after his capture , the leader of al qaeda , ayman al-zawahiri , demanded the end of cia drone strikes in pakistan and the release of terrorists held in u.s. custody in exchange for weinstein 's freedom . on september 12 , 2012 , weinstein appeared in a video produced by al qaeda 's production arm in which he said that the obama administration had shown `` no interest in my case . '' he then appealed to israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu from `` one jew to another '' to intervene . the obama administration is in the midst of a review of its hostage policy , which has been criticized by some families whose loved ones have been taken hostage by isis , al qaeda or the taliban . the key problems these families point to are lack of communication by the u.s. government about their loved ones and a lack of coordination within the government about how best to free them . the cia , for instance , is focused on drone strikes and counterterrorism operations , while the fbi has responsibility for retrieving american hostages . often these goals are not in alignment -- as was clearly the case with weinstein . the cia could have exercised more due diligence knowing that weinstein was almost certainly being held in north waziristan . there are some solutions for these problems . first , families should be granted security clearances by the u.s. government for the purpose of having classified information disclosed to them only about their captive loved ones . right now , the u.s. government wo n't communicate much with the families about their loved ones because the relatives do n't have the requisite security clearances . should families abuse their clearances , they would no longer receive classified information about their loved ones , which is a strong incentive not to abuse them . second , president barack obama should appoint a senior-level person , perhaps working in the white house on the national security council , to oversee the work of the cia , fbi , state department and the joint special operations command , which implements hostage rescues . all these organizations have key roles to play in getting american hostages home . that person must be sufficiently senior so he or she can make all the relevant agencies play well together and `` de-conflict '' any potential issues , such as the ones that surfaced in the weinstein case . third , while the u.s. government position is that it will not make concessions to terrorist groups , there is nothing in american policy to prevent another government from negotiating with terrorists to secure the release of u.s. citizens , and this should be encouraged , even if there is some quid pro quo involved . this is what happened in the case of the american journalist peter theo curtis , who was captured by al qaeda 's affiliate in syria in 2012 , but was released last year after the qatari government intervened in his case . the qataris have had longstanding ties to the militant groups in syria , including the al qaeda affiliate holding curtis , and while qatari officials have denied paying ransom to free curtis , it 's unlikely that the journalist was freed just because the members of al qaeda holding him were suddenly feeling like good guys . curtis ' successful release could provide a ray of hope for u.s. citizen caitlin coleman and her husband , canadian joshua boyle , who were captured by the taliban in 2012 when they were traveling on a trip through afghanistan . a senior american official told cnn they are being held by the haqqani network . the pakistani government has contacts with the haqqani network , and the u.s. government should ratchet up the pressure on the pakistani government to secure the couple 's release . in captivity , coleman , who was pregnant at the time she was taken hostage , had a child . the name of the child is unknown .\\xf8\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc5'-lrb- cnn -rrb- by some estimates , about a third of americans use some form of alternative medicine , including homeopathic remedies because they find western medicine inadequate . creams such as arnicare for pain relief or liquids such as sidda flower essences for male virility are part of a $ 2.9 billion business that has seen `` explosive growth , '' according to the fda . these drugs do not go through the same level of scrutiny as over-the-counter and prescription drugs . but now your over-the-counter homeopathic remedies might soon face stricter scrutiny from the federal government . products such as the homeopathic cold remedies coldese and zicam , among others , came under fire monday from experts who testified at a food and drug administration hearing monday . the two-day `` listening session , '' as the fda calls it , is an opportunity for experts and members of the public to help the fda decide how it should regulate these products . critics say the agency is not doing enough . an analysis of hundreds of published studies from the national health and medical research council in australia found that homeopathic medicine was no more effective than a placebo . there is no evidence that they actually work , the council claimed , and yet it is a multibillion dollar business . homeopathy is a medical philosophy that essentially believes your body is the best weapon to fight disease . homeopathic medicine is based on the idea that `` like cures like , '' meaning if something causes a symptom in your body , if you take a diluted form , it will boost your body 's ability to fight it . typically these remedies include a plant or a mineral in a tiny amount . do homeopathic treatments for adhd work ? people who represent the industry , such as mark land , a member of the american association of homeopathic pharmacists , argue that the current fda system is a good one and that the products available today are of high quality and label standards are enough . critics argued otherwise . dr. adriane fugh-berman testified that most people do n't entirely know what homeopathy is and `` may assume that these products are dietary supplements or are conventional drugs '' since they are often sold on the same shelves as traditional drugs . this practice is `` innately misleading , '' said fugh-berman , an associate professor in the department of pharmacology and physiology at georgetown . most consumers , she said , do n't know that the fda does n't `` routinely review these products for identity , purity , potency , quality or stability prior to marketing . '' opinion : alternative healing or quackery ? while many people believe the drugs are safe in large part because they are highly diluted , products such as cold-eeze , if taken according to the recommendations on the label , would be 10 times the recommended dietary allowance -lrb- rda -rrb- of zinc for adult females and eight times the recommendation for males , according to fugh-berman . too much zinc can have toxic effects . more than 130 people using another homeopathic medicine with zinc , zicam , reported to the fda that they lost their sense of smell . the fda issued a warning to consumers about it in 2009 . there is a misconception that all homeopathic products are `` natural '' according to the fda `` and therefore safe . unfortunately , fda has become aware of significant safety issues associated with homeopathic products in recent years , '' according to an email from the agency . other issues include a 2010 fda warning about hyland 's teething tablets . they also recalled the tablets that had inconsistent amounts of belladonna . larger doses of the substance can be toxic . in 2014 , the fda warned consumers about pleo homeopathic drug products having penicillin or derivatives of penicillin . another expert asking for stricter standards with homeopathic medicine , janine jagger with the familial mediterranean fever foundation , said that there should be stricter label standards that better explained what was actually in the homeopathic product . she believed there was a `` deceptive illusion of treatment '' when people chose these homeopathic options over pharmaceuticals that have been proven to work . a third of americans use alternative medicine . a mother and editor of an alternative medicine magazine and website , peggy o'mara , testified that homeopathic medicine has helped her family over the years . as a writer and editor of health publications , she said she has seen a growing interest in this kind of medicine , and she believes it is is well-placed . she believes people have more trust that consumers do their research before purchasing the product , as she does . she wishes doctors were better versed in this kind of medicine and believes others want `` safe , effective and easily accessible '' products that are `` nontoxic '' alternatives to help people feel better . the public hearing will continue tuesday . the fda could make decisions about these labeling and regulation standards some time this year .\\xe2\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf1%-lrb- cnn -rrb- criminal justice reform is rapidly becoming one of the few bipartisan issues of our time . it 's about time . america has the highest incarceration rate in the world , with 5 % of the world 's population and 25 % of its prisoners . nearly 2 1/2 million americans are in prison . over 65 million people , or 20 % of the country , have criminal records . most disturbingly , nearly 40 % of our country 's prisoners are african-americans , who only make up 13 % of the general population . it 's time for policymakers to address this criminal justice crisis head on . we must change the dismal status quo . we must start by asking a simple question : why are so many americans criminals ? look no further than washington , which has spent the past century devising the most complicated -- and nonsensical -- criminal code known to man . the federal criminal code includes over 4,500 laws and counting , not to mention government regulations for which there are criminal penalties . the list of federal crimes is so long , so broad and so vague that you and i likely commit three felonies every day , unwittingly breaking numerous federal laws as we go about our daily business . no wonder america 's prison population is out of control . americans are n't addicted to crime ; our politicians are addicted to criminalizing things . sadly , the criminalization of americans also traps them in poverty . according to the pew charitable trusts , incarceration leads to reduced wages -lrb- 11 % drop -rrb- , employment -lrb- nine weeks lost annually -rrb- , and earnings overall -lrb- 40 % annually -rrb- . making matters worse , over half of new prisoners are at or below the poverty line and three-quarters of former prisoners are sent back to jail within five years of their release . the deck is stacked against my generation in particular . young adults are 10 % of the population yet comprise 29 % of the country 's arrests . young african-americans are particularly at risk : they 're 15 times more likely to be in prison than whites . no wonder 18-to-29-year-olds have the lowest level of trust of any age group that our justice system treats everyone equally . thankfully , there is a bipartisan consensus in washington that something needs to be done , and fast . on the left , civil rights groups and their allies in congress have been demanding that the criminal system be fixed for years . on the right , politicians from paul ryan to rand paul are now recommending the same thing . if politicians are serious , they should consider three specific areas for reform . 1 . reduce punishment for nonviolent crimes . politicians should consider reducing nonviolent offenses from felonies to misdemeanors , and end mandatory sentencing for nonviolent crimes . the federal government 's unsuccessful war on drugs has led to unfair punishments for nonviolent drug offenders who made youthful mistakes . while some policies may have made sense in the 1980s and '90s , they now do more harm than good . those involved in the buying and selling of small amounts of drugs should n't be subjected to years or decades in prison for their crimes . and more generally , judges should be free to tailor their rulings to the specific facts and details of the case -- and the person standing before them . 2 . rebuild respect between communities and police . one-size-fits-all mandates and decrees from washington -- from drug laws to civil asset forfeiture to no-knock warrants -- create divisions between local law enforcement and the local communities they serve . practices , policies and programs that create unnecessary distrust and unease should be eliminated . it 's the same for police militarization , which has occurred in large part because washington has supplied local agencies with weapons and tools that are inappropriate for use in local communities . letting local communities set their own law enforcement policies will go a long way toward restoring the trust that right now seems almost nonexistent . 3 . give ex-nonviolent offenders a second chance . too many reformed convicts return to jail because they face insurmountable barriers that keep them from living a normal life . legislators can begin fixing this by encouraging greater record-sealing and expungement for youthful , non violent offenders , thereby giving people who made mistakes a greater chance of finding work and rejoining society . reducing licensing barriers and restoring voting rights for those with criminal backgrounds should also be considered . this list is only a starting point , yet our elected officials could -- and should -- quickly and easily take it up . in our era of hyperpartisanship , we should focus on those few things on which americans agree . fixing our country 's broken criminal justice system should be at the top of the list .\\xa4\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf1 -lrb- cnn -rrb- we belong to different generations and political parties . we live in different states and under different circumstances . one of us is a college student , born into a political family , while the other is a former congressman from south carolina and father of five children . one of us served on the selection committee for the john f. kennedy profile in courage award . the other will receive this award in recognition of the stand he took when he broke with his party and sacrificed his political career to support responsible action to combat climate change . we share an unwavering belief that the united states must lead the world on climate change and seize opportunities for unity , growth and progress . we believe that president kennedy 's courageous leadership in space exploration holds lessons that can help guide us forward . in 1962 , president kennedy , speaking at rice university , described the space program that he had first announced when he asked the congress to support his ambitious goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the decade . opening his speech , kennedy stated simply the effect of man 's scientific pursuit : `` the greater our knowledge increases , the greater our ignorance unfolds . '' this curious paradox holds true today . our knowledge of the causes and dangers of climate change has increased even as our ignorance of its ramifications has unfolded . many of our elected representatives persist in inaction and complacency by arguing that individual nations are powerless to solve the problem because every nation is culpable . others choose to dispute the science , deny the evidence , and avoid the question of how to solve the problem . but climate change is only scary if we choose to sit , wait and do nothing about it . president kennedy encountered the same dilemma : `` it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest , to wait . but ... this country of the united states was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them . '' we need not be frightened today . climate change is a chance for all of us to add a chapter to the story of american triumph and human progress . it is a moment for this generation to display the very qualities we attribute to the american political heroes of earlier times , who left the world a better place for us . courage of this scale will come from a people who are told that they can do great things by leaders who believe that their people are capable of great things . we believe that america will see opportunity in the danger of climate change just like we saw benefits on earth from travel in space . kennedy told the crowd at rice that the pursuit of a goal that seemed impossible was valuable precisely because it would be so hard to accomplish . `` we choose to go to the moon not because it is easy but because it is hard , '' he said . something so difficult would only be achieved through cooperation and national unity , and it would push us toward greatness . there will always be reasons for inaction . many will argue that responsible reforms will hurt our economy as it recovers from the great recession . they will exploit the fears of that time to justify extracting rents from industries and fuels whose days are numbered . progress on climate change will require courage . some leaders who stand up to meet the challenge may fall , but they can be sure that their sacrifice will light the world with more energy , more mobility and more freedom and ensure a healthier planet . we can start by making straightforward changes in the tax code that are acceptable to both the right and the left . by adopting policies that would make it in our trading partners ' interest to join us , meaningful reforms can provide solutions without making government any bigger . as americans , we are obligated to leave the world a better place than we found it . we believe , just as president kennedy did , that only if america leads on the most important issues of our time can we deliver on that promise . we call on our elected leaders to embrace the climate challenge before us and light a path to greatness once again .6\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x8fVwashington -lrb- cnn -rrb- in 2011 , al qaeda took warren weinstein hostage . then , about a year later , his family paid money to his captors , said a pakistani source who was in regular contact with the kidnappers . it did not lead to the american aid worker 's release , and he was inadvertently killed in an anti-terror strike in january , the white house announced thursday . after the transfer of funds in 2012 , the captors , who never referred to themselves as `` al qaeda , '' but instead as `` afghans , '' began demanding prisoners be released in exchange for weinstein , most prominently dr. aafia siddiqui of pakistan , the source said . she has been described as the `` poster girl '' for islamic jihad and is serving an 86-year sentence in the united states . the militants also wanted the release of local militants who hailed from the pakistani province of waziristan , along the afghan border , the source said . the men on the other end of the phone spoke pashto with an accent typical for the border region . and they were professional in their dealings , said the source , who noticed a marked change after the money was paid . the people who had originally talked to the source about weinstein vanished and were replaced by new voices on the phone . the militants also connected themselves with other terror events . after isis beheaded american james foley , weinstein 's afghan captors told the source that `` the iraqis '' were asking for the american and that they were preparing an `` orange suit '' for him -- a reference to the suits that victims have worn when isis militants murdered them . when the taliban released u.s. army sgt. bowe bergdahl , a militant on the phone bragged to the source that he had been one of bergdahl 's kidnappers . they had said , at one point , that if they did kill weinstein , they 'd announce it in a big way , because he was too big a catch not to publicly celebrate . the captors had called the source daily since sometime in 2012 , and the last time the source spoke with them , in early april , they said that weinstein was still alive . in spite of a request for proof of life , the militants did n't give one . after that , the calls stopped . the source never had a number for the militants ; they had always been the ones who called . the source declined to comment on the amount of money transferred to the captors , leaving the disclosure to weinstein 's family . could weinstein have been saved ? weinstein 's family in maryland was initially reluctant to take their case to congress . weinstein 's wife , elaine , and his two daughters worried that drawing attention to their loved one 's plight -- especially media attention -- would make weinstein , a government contractor working with usaid in pakistan , a more valuable hostage to his al qaeda captors . but the family switched course and went to their representatives in congress in late 2013 after a video of weinstein -- frail and apparently in declining health -- surfaced in which he said he felt `` totally abandoned and forgotten '' by his country . will the drone debate return ? more than a year later , that reluctance evolved into a close bond between the weinsteins and the maryland delegation of lawmakers and staff who pressed weinstein 's case with the obama administration as well as pakistan . the congressional offices helped the family navigate the maze of government agencies working to free their loved one , according to one of those lawmakers and a senate aide . `` we do n't get choked up too often at work , '' algene sajery said as she held back tears . `` but this is really hard . '' sajery is a foreign policy adviser to sen. ben cardin , d-maryland , who worked closely on the case . after the white house announced that weinstein had been accidentally killed in a january u.s. drone strike , the aide 's first call was to weinstein 's daughters . `` myself and my colleague worked really closely with them , talked to them all the time ... they 're just such good people , '' sajery said of the family . `` there 's a personal connection there . '' cardin and his staff had tracked the weinstein case since news of his abduction surfaced in august 2011 , but when the family reached out to get help pressing their case , cardin 's staff joined forces with rep. john delaney , the weinsteins ' congressman , and began setting up meetings for the family . cardin 's staff set up meetings for the senator and weinstein 's family with everyone from the u.s. special representative to afghanistan and pakistan to the pakistani ambassador in washington . cardin and sen. barbara mikulski , d-maryland , wrote to president barack obama , calling on the u.s. to beef up efforts to secure weinstein 's release and dedicate more resources to the cause . and the staff and lawmakers helped the weinsteins weave through the network of agencies -- from the fbi to the state department and the white house -- working to bring weinstein home . `` we focused on making sure that the capabilities of the government was well coordinated , '' delaney told cnn on thursday . `` the government is a bureaucracy , and you have to make sure that it 's working . '' but for the weinsteins and the families of other american hostages held by terror groups abroad , the government has n't always worked well enough -- a frustration that was palpable to the staffers on capitol hill who worked to help them . al qaeda hostage warren weinstein killed . `` unfortunately , the assistance we received from other elements of the u.s. government was inconsistent and disappointing over the course of three and a half years , '' elaine weinstein said in a statement thursday . `` we hope that my husband 's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the u.s. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families . '' it 's a criticism that has resurfaced as the families of american hostages were killed abroad spoke up and voiced their frustrations with what they characterized as insufficient u.s. government efforts to bring their loved ones home . delaney was `` saddened , disappointed and outraged that our government was not able to bring warren home , '' he said in a statement thursday . and in an interview with cnn later in the day , he strayed away from blaming the obama administration or people in various u.s. agencies , instead pointing the finger at a disjointed system . the weinstein family 's frustration with that system boiled over last summer when bergdahl , the u.s. army sergeant , was released by a taliban-affiliated group in exchange for five guantanamo bay prisoners . the u.s. policy of not negotiating with terrorists appeared to have an exception . `` it 's one of those things where it 's both there 's some hope , but at the same time it caused them some great frustration , '' delaney recalled , saying the family asked : `` why not warren ? '' but as the state department called the bergdahl exchange a `` unique situation , '' the weinsteins ' hopes were dashed . `` that 's when they asked us to really step up our efforts , '' sajery said . `` that 's when they decided to really go public . '' delaney introduced a resolution calling on the obama administration to use all tools necessary to bring weinstein home and make his return -- and that of other u.s. hostages abroad -- a top priority . mikulski , cardin and sens. dick durbin and mark kirk of illinois pushed a similar resolution in the senate . and the weinsteins took to the airwaves , with alisa weinstein appearing on cnn 's `` ac360 '' to make a public appeal for her father 's release -- and for the u.s. government to do more to secure his freedom . `` my father is just as deserving of freedom as sgt. bergdahl , as are all of the americans who are being held abroad , '' she said on cnn last june . `` you can not distinguish between these hostages . ... they ca n't just pick and choose , decide that it works to get one person out and then leave everybody else there . '' white house press secretary josh earnest on thursday said that `` significant resources '' were dedicated to try to free weinstein and that `` as painful as it is , '' the u.s policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place , arguing that removing that policy could promote kidnappings abroad and put more americans at risk . and state department acting spokeswoman marie harf said many officials at the department were in touch with the weinsteins throughout the process . while the u.s. policy of not negotiating with terrorists would remain in place , the state department is reviewing how it works to secure the release of american hostages held by terrorists abroad , she said . the white house announced the review last fall , which obama ordered last summer after terrorists killed or kidnapped americans abroad . speaking at the office of the director of national intelligence on friday , obama reiterated that the white house will review what happened . `` we all bleed when we lose an american life , '' he said . `` we all grieve when any innocent life is taken . we do n't take this work lightly . '' obama made to sure to praise the intelligence community overall , noting that much of their accomplishments remain classified , while only their failures become public . `` the world does n't always see your successes -- the threats you prevent , or the terrorist attacks you thwart , or the lives that you save , '' obama said . `` it can be frustrating sometimes , but that 's part of the function of our democracy . but i know what you do . '' but delaney , the weinsteins ' congressman , is revving up to push for more reforms that will make government agencies more effective at finding and freeing american hostages held abroad . delaney on thursday called on the government to streamline the efforts of various agencies and countries in the region that help the u.s. find american hostages -- an effort he 's been pushing in recent months . the tragedy of weinstein 's death could be just the momentum needed to spur those reforms . `` i think that every single american wants any american held hostage returned , '' delaney said . `` there 's tremendous support to do more . '' on friday , elaine weinstein said in a statement that the family has `` been moved by the tremendous outpouring of support from around the world . '' `` we appreciate the sympathy and condolences we have received from those who knew the warren we loved so much as well as those who did not , '' the statement said . `` our thoughts and prayers are with the families of others who have been taken hostage around the world as they endure these terrible ordeals .

      "b\"\\xf9(-lrb- cnn -rrb- a sweat-smothered man in a wide-brimmed hat , knee-high leather boots and a khaki uniform machetes his way through lush jungle foliage . as thick tangles of vine fall beneath his blade , he pushes into a clearing , then suddenly staggers back . the fanged mouth of a primordial stone beast gapes toward him . before him rise the crumbled ruins of an enormous portal of rock , black with age but with a colossal grandeur not yet lost -- a fine example of what archaeologists call a `` zoomorphic portal '' or , more popularly , a `` monster mouth gate . '' what was once the gateway to an ancient mayan city , built circa 700 ad and mysteriously abandoned four centuries later , stands before him . he has found the lost city of lagunita . now that the planet has been mapped , circumnavigated , measured and tagged in every way imaginable , the age of explorers discovering new worlds seems a quaint memory . but there are still adventurers exploring forgotten corners of the globe , and some find astonishing things . one such explorer , part indiana jones , part magellan , is slovenian archaeologist ivan \\xc5\\xa0prajc . the sprightly \\xc5\\xa0prajc wears the weathered face of a man who has spent much of his 60 years beneath a hot sun at excavations , or hacking his way through dense jungle . he has been the first to see ancient pyramids , 30 meters high , that he spotted in aerial photographs from his office among the baroque mitteleuropean cobbled streets of ljubljana , slovenia , some 10,000 kilometers away . but in terms of the thrill of discovery , it does n't get any better than his encounter with lagunita 's monster portal . what does it feel like to find a lost city ? `` it 's a victory , '' says \\xc5\\xa0prajc , `` especially when the efforts are long . on several occasions we 've had two , three weeks of just cutting through the bush to get to some location , without knowing what we would find . when we get to the site it feels like a big victory , like we 've done it . if it had been easy , then other people would have done it already . '' since 1996 , he and his team have discovered more than 80 ancient mayan cities in the jungles of mexico , few of which the modern world had known before . but how can an entire city , which once may have been home to tens of thousands , simply vanish ? \\xc5\\xa0prajc explains that the region in which he has found such riches had gone unexplored because it 's so inaccessible : `` it 's so hard to get there . it 's a biosphere , a protected natural area that has never been densely populated since the collapse of the classical mayans , for the past thousand years or so . '' when a primal jungle is allowed to grow rampant for centuries , it can indeed swallow entire cities . but just why so many settlements were simply abandoned , long before the arrival of the spanish conquistadors , remains a mystery to which these long lost sites may provide an answer . `` ninety-nine percent of settlements in the central and southern lowlands of the yucatan peninsula were abandoned in a matter of 200 years . by 1000 ad , practically everything was abandoned . that was the situation when the spaniards came . but not so in the northern section of the peninsula and the guatemala highlands , where there was no rupture until the arrival of the spaniards . '' so what happened in that enormous area that led to this mass evacuation ? `` nobody knows the exact sequence of events , but it was definitely a combination of droughts , climate change , -lrb- and -rrb- overpopulation , but other things must have come as consequences : devastating raids and wars among the mayan states , which resembled the constantly battling ancient greek city-states . `` in this late classical period , wars intensified with devastating consequences , for if one city-state was destroyed or overcome , it had a ripple effect on trade networks . it was a sort of globalized mayan world . '' to learn more would require extensive , time-consuming surveys of each site , which is a different sort of fieldwork than \\xc5\\xa0prajc likes to practice . his team will map what appears to be the core of a settlement , but there simply is n't time or manpower to map it all , so hundreds of structures are left for others to survey and excavate . the adrenaline of the treasure hunt is what drives \\xc5\\xa0prajc , the `` eureka '' moment when he finds the buried treasure . he is not in the least proprietary about what he discovers , preferring to let other research teams dive in to the sites he has found to slowly excavate , catalogue and analyze what he finds . '' -lsb- this extensive mapping -rsb- is not our job . we are taking the first step into an unknown area . '' \\xc5\\xa0prajc is a throwback to the great 19th century explorers -- a dying breed as the world becomes smaller and science bleaches out its mysteries . but in the heat of the jungle , science can only get you so far . intrepid spirit , calloused palms , sweat , blood and patience are more important than gadgetry . as \\xc5\\xa0prajc likes to say , `` we can survive without computers , but not without machetes .

      "b\"\\xc23melbourne , australia -lrb- cnn -rrb- a man stands on a beach in a distant land . waves lap his ankles . he wades through the gentle dawn light , arms outstretched , his head held high . he is fully dressed ; not a tourist but a freedom fighter . a photograph of this man , beamed around the world , becomes a universal symbol of the struggle against tyranny and the sweet triumph of liberty . it is 2015 . the man is peter greste . if you thought the man might have been an anzac on the shores of gallipoli , such is the power of persuasion . it 's easy to lead a horse to water when , in the centenary year of the gallipoli campaign , our nation is at saturation point with battlefield remembrance . the sum total of television programming , beer advertising , political grandstanding and opportunistic marketing suggests that the historical legacy of australia 's involvement in the first world war boils down to a simple equation : young -lrb- white -rrb- man plus distant beach equals sacrifice . there is nothing intrinsically wrong with military commemoration that honors the dead . last weekend i planted gallipoli rosemary in my backyard ; part of the proceeds go to the avenues of honour , a national project to preserve and restore australia 's living memorials . more objectionable is the fact that war remembrance is played like it is a zero sum game . to widen the scope of historical tribute , and also recall the words and deeds of the australian men and women who fought against the prescribed route of militaristic sentiment , is to risk being branded disrespectful and divisive . but the unassailable fact is that the first world war ripped australia asunder . even at the time , the great war itself was divisive , a historical reality belied by today 's bland , blanket coverage of `` the anzac spirit '' . australia 's participation in the war was contested from the outset . on august 11 , 1914 , veteran political campaigner vida goldstein wrote in her woman voter newspaper : `` it is a fearful reflection on 2,000 years of christianity that men have rushed into war before using every combined effort to prevent this appalling conflict . '' as she had done 20 years earlier in mobilizing forces around the issue of female suffrage , goldstein rallied her own army of foot soldiers with fighting words . `` the time has come for women to show that they , as givers of life , refuse to give their sons as material for slaughter . '' australian and new zealand women had a unique advantage in shaping public debate : the vote . `` the enfranchised women of australia are political units in the british empire , '' goldstein argued , `` and they ought to lead the world in sane methods of dealing with these conflicts . '' goldstein 's early entreaties failed to bite with the general populace . under the newly legislated war precautions act , the woman voter suffered censorship , leading goldstein and her women 's peace army to fight on multiple fronts : `` we are fighting for civil liberty and against military despotism . '' around the nation , trade unionists opposed to `` the capitalist war '' joined the movement . australia had the only entirely voluntary military service among the allied forces ; less than 40 % of eligible men signed up to fight `` for king and country . '' as the carnage at gallipoli brought home the realities of war , recruitment fell and peace activism became more widespread . general strikes halted industry , as workers reacted to the food shortages , unemployment and rising poverty that threatened the social accord of `` the working man 's paradise . '' with enlistments falling away in 1916 , prime minister billy hughes pushed for conscription and pushed through the unlawful associations act . groups that voiced opposition to the war , like the international workers of the world , were banned and dissidents were jailed for publishing material `` likely to cause disaffection or alarm '' . when waterfront workers and coal miners went on strike , the war precautions act was invoked to send them back to work . in september 1916 , the sydney twelve were arrested and tried for treason . `` fifteen years for 15 words '' was how one of the prisoners described his crime and punishment . the conscription referendums of october 28 , 1916 , and december 20 , 1917 , became a massive rallying point for people who opposed the war -- or the federal government 's domestic policies . there were diverse reasons for that opposition , including the anti-british sentiments of irish catholic australians . in melbourne , the meeting place for such public debate was yarra bank , a pocket of land nestled between what today is birrarung marr and the rod laver arena . anti-conscription demonstrations saw up to 100,000 people gather on the dusty banks of dirty brown yarra river . most protest meetings were peaceful , but one became infamously violent . `` riotous scenes at yarra bank '' , headlines around the nation proclaimed , when a demonstration organized by the women 's peace army in the week before the 1916 referendum turned nasty and returned servicemen began to attack female speakers . both conscription referendums ultimately failed . the australian dictionary of biography contains profiles of 174 anti-conscriptionists , many of whom went to jail , including vida goldstein 's compatriots adela pankhurst and jennie baines . baines was imprisoned for refusing to pay the fine she was issued for flying a red flag at yarra bank in 1918 . she is reputedly the first australian prisoner to go on a hunger strike . other protesters were deported . as historian janet butler reminds us : `` it does take a special kind of bravery to stand against the tide . '' the enduring legacies of the first world war emanate beyond the battlefields of gallipoli , manifested not only in the `` shattered anzacs '' whose families bore the burden of care , but also in the class and sectarian divisions that shaped australia 's social and political relations in the 20th century . lest we also forget that the democratic freedoms we hold dear today -- freedom of the press , freedom of assembly , freedom of speech -- were won in battles fought on home soil by courageous women and men who sacrificed much , but are still accorded little recognition . perhaps , by the 125th anniversary of the gallipoli campaign , when we again celebrate our national liberation narratives , we will come to associate riverbanks , as well as beaches , with the potent ebb and flow of freedom . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .\\x00\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xba!-lrb- cnn -rrb- giovanni lo porto put himself in harm 's way to help , heading to pakistan to work on a much needed reconstruction project following deadly flooding there . his work and his life , as he knew it then , came to a halt on january 19 , 2012 . that 's when , according to italy 's state-run ansa news agency , four armed men burst into the building where lo porto lived and abducted him along with colleague bernd muehlenbeck . two years later , lo porto was dead -- killed accidentally by a u.s. drone strike , according to american authorities . the native of the sicilian city of palermo died along with a fellow al qaeda hostage , american warren weinstein . that same counterterrorism operation in a border region of afghanistan and pakistan killed at least one al qaeda leader , ahmed farouq , who was also a u.s. citizen . his family members , including his four brothers , called him giancarlo . lo porto grew up in sicily and then studied at london metropolitan university , getting his undergraduate degree there in peace and conflict studies in 2010 , according to the school . a professor there remembers him as `` passionate , friendly -lrb- and -rrb- open-minded , '' according to an ansa report . and the university , in a statement , described him as `` a popular student who was committed to helping others . '' `` we are tremendously proud of him and the humanitarian work he did , '' the school said . at the time he was taken captive , lo porto worked with the german aid organization welthungerlife , a 53-year-old group dedicated to fighting hunger and poverty worldwide . such work means going to places where the need is most -- places like multan in pakistan . that community was one of many in pakistan devastated by major flooding in 2010 , which covered about one-fifth of the country and left more than 1,500 people dead . these conditions are all too common in the south asian nation , as evidenced by flooding one year later that forced upwards of 660,000 into refugee camps and killed more than 430 people , about a quarter of whom were children . `` he told me , ` i 'm pleased to have returned to asia and pakistan , i love the people , culture and food in this part of the world , ' '' said the london metropolitan university professor . specifically , lo porto was a project manager with welthungerlife 's clean water and sanitation program , working with 8 to 10 fellow international staffers and 100 to 200 locals starting in october 2011 , according to simone pott , a spokeswoman for the aid group . pott described lo porto as a lively , very positive man who made friends all over the world . some of those friends in italy , england and beyond pressed for lo porto 's release after he was taken captive , urging italy 's government and newspaper editors to get his story out , ansa reported . the same story said that al qaeda -lrb- after first claiming he was being held -rrb- denied abducting lo porto , as did the pakistani taliban . muehlenbeck , a german national , was freed last october , at which time he said that he and his colleague had been separated , according to ansa . but lo porto never got the chance to savor freedom again , like his german counterpart . italian foreign minister paolo gentiloni said his country 's government `` carried out every effort possible to trace and try to return giovanni to his loved ones . '' `` unfortunately , the conclusion is now different -lrb- than we wanted -rrb- because of the tragic and fatal mistake of our american allies , which has been recognized by president obama , '' gentiloni said . `` the responsibility of his death and -lrb- that -rrb- of warren weinstein ... is that of the terrorists . '' on thursday , after the u.s. government reported lo porto 's death , italian prime minister matteo renzi expressed his `` deepest sorrow for the death of an italian who dedicated his life to the service of others . '' lo porto 's death left those at his former charity welthungerlife speechless and confused , pott said . and then there are his family members like his mother , who ansa reports became `` another person '' after her son 's kidnapping . `` her only hope was to embrace giovanni , '' a neighbor said . cnn 's hadia messia contributed to this report .,\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x8c%-lrb- cnn -rrb- she predicted events that unfolded in the middle east well before they happened . and her book on iraq became required reading for many military leaders trying to understand the country . veteran journalist and author sandra mackey died sunday , her son , colin mackey , said . she was 77 . her extensive career began in anonymity . she was an undercover reporter working for u.s. newspapers from saudi arabia as her husband , dr. dan mackey , worked in a riyadh hospital . for four years , she hid her writing from the authorities and smuggled her stories out of the country to get around saudi arabia 's prohibition on foreign journalists . her work appeared under the pseudonym michael collins . as she chronicled what was happening around her , mackey 's distinctive voice began to emerge . over the years , a stream of books followed . `` the saudis : inside the desert kingdom '' offered `` a rare first-hand glimpse into the hidden realm of saudi social and public life , '' the new york times wrote . her 1992 book `` passion and politics : the turbulent world of the arabs '' helped bridge gaps in understanding between arabs and americans , critics wrote . mackey wrote for the people she knew , in a layman 's language that was rooted in her training as a high school history teacher . `` scholars may be put off by mackey 's occasionally florid , bombastic language , but her work is a sound analysis and a sympathetic yet balanced effort to explain arab perspectives to americans , '' elizabeth r. hayford wrote in library journal . after earning a history degree from the university of central oklahoma , mackey attended the university of virginia to study international relations . she graduated in the first class of women admitted to the graduate program . for her book on iran , mackey was three times able to win permission to travel through the country unaccompanied , allowing her to paint an intimate portrait of a country going through extraordinary change . her 2002 book `` the reckoning -- iraq and the legacy of saddam hussein '' portended some of the outcomes of the war in iraq -- but also drew some sharp criticism . `` if war prevails , we shall beget a greater disorder in the persian gulf , '' mackey wrote in the book . `` we will be sucked into the resentments of the arab world , the hostilities of the iraqis , and the challenge of nation building in what has become an intensely tribal society at the core of american vital interests in the oil-rich persian gulf . '' fouad ajami , the late hoover institute fellow who was also a frequent guest on cnn , took issue with the book . `` the crowds in baghdad and basra -lrb- like the crowds in kabul that greeted their liberators with kites and music -rrb- may yet embarrass mackey and the countless naive people who see things her way , '' ajami wrote for the new york times ' sunday book review cover story in 2002 . mackey had an oklahoma twang , the slightly nasal kind that she was proud of , but that belied her worldly understanding . she would use it to full effect when she wanted to put people at ease . mackey was a frequent commentator on cnn during the gulf war in the 1990s . she also appeared on countless other outlets , including bill maher 's `` politically incorrect , '' to explain in layman 's terms what was happening in the region . her book on iraq was published one year before the u.s.-led invasion of the country in 2003 . the book forewarned of the consequences of such action . `` in a perfect world , shia , sunni , and kurd , followed by a company of other minorities , would walk into the post-hussein iraq as a liberated people united by common suffering , '' mackey wrote . `` but as all those who plot the way of nations are so acutely aware , the world is not perfect . '' she said those calling for an invasion of iraq `` can not ignore the threats to american security that could come with hussein 's demise . '' `` with american troops on the ground and no governing authority capable of taking charge , the united states faces the real possibility of a secular version of militant islam , '' mackey said . '' ... thus , american military forces rotate in and out , u.s. taxpayer money finances the occupation , and iraqi hostility to a western presence increases . there is no exit strategy except retreat . '' in 2004 the u.s. military actually flew mackey to iraq to teach commanders from the army 's 1st infantry division while the war was still raging . her book on iraq became required reading for many military officers . `` i am literally a little old lady in tennis shoes , '' she used to joke about her ability to gain the confidence of countless sources . `` what 's the harm in talking to me ?

      "b\"\\x95!-lrb- cnn -rrb- saturday 's deadly earthquake in nepal was the `` big one '' experts were waiting for based on the region 's history . earthquakes are a fact of life in the south asian country , with tremors of magnitude 4 or 5 occurring several times each year , geologist and science journalist kate ravilious said . with the last major earthquake in 1934 , the concern was not if , but when the next `` great '' earthquake would hit , said ravilious , author of the 2014 article , `` kathmandu 's earthquake nightmare . '' in a landlocked country like nepal , where infrastructure is fragile to begin with , the consequences of such an earthquake had the potential to be `` much more serious , '' ravilious told cnn . those fears were realized when a magnitude-7 .8 earthquake centered less than 50 miles from the national capital of kathmandu rocked nepal , toppling homes , historic buildings and leaving more 1,400 dead , authorities said . `` this event , while large and tragic , is not unusual for that region of the world as the whole mountain range stretching from tibet almost to caspian sea is an area of major collision between continental plates , '' said geological engineer nicholas sitar with the university of california , berkeley 's department of civil and environmental engineering . what 's different this time from 1934 is the size and density of kathmandu , which suffered the brunt of damage in both earthquakes . `` the population has exploded in several decades , '' u.s. geological survey spokesman gavin hayes told cnn . `` when you get a vast population in the kind of building infrastructure that is n't equipped to handle shaking of an earthquake this size , that 's when you see the scale of disaster we 're seeing now . '' the big unknown is what happens next , now that the initial rumbles of the quake have passed , ravilious said . how will emergency response teams enter the landlocked country , whose single international airport is closed ? how will transports carrying aid move through the country if roads are destroyed ? if and when landslides start , how will mountainside villages in the himalayan range fare ? and , will it all be resolved before monsoon season starts ? `` the worry now is to get nepal up and running again on feet , '' ravilious said . `` the monsoons in a couple of months could make things worse if we do n't sort things out before then . '' an earthquake is the ground shaking caused by a sudden slip on a fault , according to the u.s. geological survey . stresses in the earth 's outer layer push the sides of the fault together , releasing energy in waves that travel through the earth 's crust and cause the shaking felt during an earthquake . nepal is located on a major plate boundary between india and eurasia , where collisions have been in progress for about 50 million years . those collisions are responsible for the construction of the himalayas , which has the tallest and some of the fastest growing mountains in the world , said chris goldfinger , director of oregon state university 's active tectonics and seafloor mapping laboratory . india is moving northward into eurasia at a rate of about 45 millimeters a year , with earthquakes of a magnitude from 8 to 9 occurring on average in the himalaya every 500 to 1,000 years , said marin k. clark , associate professor of geological sciences with the university of michigan 's department of earth and environmental sciences . the last major earthquake to affect this part of the himalayas was in the 1500s , and kathmandu was badly damaged in an earthquake that occurred farther east of saturday 's quake in 1934 . a major concern for this earthquake is damage from landslides generated by the strong shaking , clark said . the entire area that experienced shaking was in steep , mountainous topography where landsliding is a significant hazard . clark compared the circumstances to the 2008 earthquake in sichuan province , china . the magnitude-7 .9 earthquake generated more 200,000 landslides , many of which blocked roads , slowing response and recovery efforts . the landslides also blocked river valleys , which created significant flood hazard . `` we might anticipate a similar situation for nepal .

'' but neither the patriots nor the nfl has anything to be ashamed of in how they handled the hernandez case . they did everything right this time . hours after hernandez was charged with murder , he was let go from the team . and his coaches did n't spend any time trying to convince the public that their star tight end was a decent , family-loving guy , as the league has done too many times in the past when its players got in trouble . this time justice worked . there 's no reason to second-guess what went wrong , to ask `` how could a star nfler be a murderer ? '' the nfl for the most part does a great job vetting its players , and certainly hernandez is an anomaly in the league , where despite the ugly headlines , the overwhelming majority of players are upstanding , law-abiding citizens . and patriots bashers -lrb- me included -rrb- would be mistaken to try to find fault with the team for drafting hernandez despite his troubled past . no one really knows what evil lurks in the hearts of others , even those closest to us . not the mothers whose sons go off and commit schoolyard killing sprees , or wives whose husbands gun down innocent people , and certainly not employers who are mostly concerned about performance on the job . there was no way to predict hernandez would end up a murderer . he was a guy who had all the talent and opportunity in the world , but he still went wrong . hernandez himself may have explained it best as he was being taken out of the courtroom : . according to a law enforcement source close to the case , hernandez told officers escorting him , '' ` hey man , i 'm going to miss you guys . ... i do n't need any luck any more .

'' most turks agree with gurgen . ninety-one percent of turks do not believe that the events of 1915 -- when , according to armenians , 1.5 million ethnic armenians were systematically killed in the final years of the ottoman empire -- were genocide , according to a recent poll . it 's a sentiment shared by the turkish government , which denies that a genocide took place , maintaining that hundreds of thousands of turkish muslims and armenian christians died in intercommunal violence around the bloody battlefields of world war i. turkey also disputes armenia 's count of the numbers killed , putting it at 300,000 . it 's a heavily disputed position -- the killings are widely viewed by scholars as genocide and the armenian government and diaspora are lobbying for wider recognition in the international community . armenian prime minister hovik abrahamyan said friday in statement that turkey 's ottoman rulers had planned and carried out a `` monstrous crime '' in the years of world war i and called on more countries to recognize and condemn the genocide . many armenians living in turkey still feel treated as second-class citizens . however many have hope that turkey 's younger generation is more willing to accept that a genocide occurred than their parents . `` students are much , much more liberal , '' says diana van , whose grandparents escaped the mass killings . van is a member of the delegation for the armenian genocide commemoration and is writing her masters thesis on the issue at ankara university . `` they have access to alternative information written in english , which is not taught in school -lrb- in turkey -rrb- . with more access to books , to alternative information , and with a larger democratization process , turkey will be able to face its history . '' a century after her armenian ancestors escaped death in eastern turkey , van says she is frustrated that turkey is unwilling to accept what happened . `` your identity is denied by turkey , '' she says . `` they do not want to face this past . in turkey , the word armenian is still used as a curse . whenever you want to hurt somebody , you say , ` you are like an armenian . ' '' van says an admission of genocide by turkey would largely be symbolic . while her grandparents lost their land , she has returned to their villages and she recognizes that trying to reclaim it would be impossible . `` i do not believe that this is going to happen , '' she says of the territorial claims made by many armenians . `` one hundred years have passed . i went to my ancestors ' land , and i saw those armenian lands full of kurdish people , who have five to 16 children per family , and i saw that it 's not anatolia . it 's not my homeland that i had in my imagination . '' a growing number of scholars and world leaders believe that what happened should be called genocide . germany looks set to join the european parliament , france , austria , canada and some 20 other countries in labeling the atrocity a `` genocide . '' two weeks ago the pope referred to mass killings as `` the first genocide of the 20th century '' -- a move that infuriated turkish president recep tayyip erdogan , who called the claim `` nonsense '' and recalled his ambassador to the vatican . some notable countries do not recognize the killings as genocide , including the uk and israel and earlier this week u.s. president barack obama , wary of damaging relations with turkey amid growing unrest in the middle east , did not use the word genocide . there are several reasons why turkey maintains its position on the issue . turks say that to most people there the term `` genocide '' is associated with nazis -- not the beloved founders of modern turkey . last year , the turkish government expressed condolences to armenians , and accepted that hundreds of thousands of their ancestors died as they were marched out of cities and towns in central and eastern anatolia in the waning years of the ottoman empire . but the government called it a `` necessary deportation '' during the messy and violent period of transition leading up to world war i -- when many armenian radicals were threatening to side with russia . turkey says that there was never a deliberate , ethnically-driven effort to exterminate the armenian population . `` it was a wartime precaution , like the u.s. relocated the japanese population during world war ii , '' says dr. kamer kasim , dean of abant izzet baysal university . kasim dismisses the drive for the `` genocide '' label as little more than a propaganda campaign being waged by the armenian diaspora . politics and timing is another issue . at a time when president erdogan is in full campaign mode ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections , he is attempting to assuage concerns about unemployment and slowed growth by drumming up nationalist fervor with promises of a `` new turkey '' akin to the glory days of the ottoman empire . it 's hardly the time to label the country 's founders as murderers . that would n't play well with turks , many of whom have gone through years of schooling that instilled in them a fierce pride in their past . in the same way that american schools often whitewashed the history of u.s. settlers and their relations with native americans , turkish schools have long taken an airbrush to the `` young turks . '' the movement , which began in 1908 , was comprised of the army officers who were in power as the country transitioned from the hands of spoiled sultans to mustafa kemal atat\\xc3\\xbcrk -- the much-adored leader who came to power in 1923 and is credited with founding the modern turkish state . the taboo surrounding the use of the word genocide began to crack about a decade ago when two of turkey 's best-selling international authors , orhan pamuk and elif safak , joined other intellectuals in raising the issue of whether the country 's forefathers had committed genocide . pamuk and safak were met with crushing resistance . they were harangued in the court of public opinion , and tried in real-life court on charges of `` insulting turkishness . '' since 2003 , turkish schools have been forbidden from using the term genocide . calling the events of 1915 a genocide would undermine the very narratives the turks hold most dear , says burcu gultekin punsmann , a senior analyst at ankara policy center who has studied turkish-armenian relations for a decade . she says the country simply is n't ready to dismantle the foundation it was built on , or stain the legacy of its founders . `` turkey is still too young and too insecure to rewrite its history and question the events unfolding at the establishment of the republic , '' punsmann says . but in a statement issued to mark the anniversary of the killings , president erdogan urged dialogue , saying '' ... as descendants of two ancient peoples who a hundred years ago shared the same destiny whether in joy or in sorrow , our common responsibility , and calling , today is to heal century old wounds and re-establish our human ties once again . turkey will not remain indifferent to this responsibility and will continue to do its utmost for friendship and peace . '' but there are other issues , including fears that an official recognition of genocide could unleash a flood of lawsuits against the turkish government . in 2006 , descendants of exiled armenians filed suit in a u.s. court against two german banks for restitution of assets , based on evidence that ottoman ministries required that seized armenian assets be turned over to the government and transferred to banks in germany . one 97-year-old armenian woman living in the u.s. claims to have land deeds proving that her parents owned land that now houses an airport . her case is winding its way through the turkish court system , but her lawyer , ali elbeyoglu , says the genocide debate has no effect : `` we have deeds , so we are following the law and politics do n't matter . '' others say that the genocide is distracting the country from more pressing issues between turkey and armenia , like the closed border between the two hostile neighbors . aybars gorgulu , a foreign policy expert at tesev , one of turkey 's leading think tanks , argues that it is armenia , not turkey , which suffers most from the tensions surrounding the issue . and he says it is n't in armenia 's best interest to push hard for a recognition of genocide that he does n't believe will ever come . `` there 's no diplomatic relations between the countries , and that plays into why turks think there 's a crazy diaspora obsessed with genocide , but that 's not true , '' gorgulu says . `` the best thing for armenia would be to enter into dialogue with turkey , normalize relations , and open the border . '' meanwhile , the publicity surrounding the anniversary on friday has prompted debate amongst turks of all ages . on sunday there will be a conference at bogazici university on the atrocity -- one of few in turkey that openly uses the term genocide . nisan gul goker , a 21-year-old art management student with bright pink lipstick , is one of the few turks who believes that her country should change course . `` they keep referring to this as an ` armenian incident ' in quotations and ca n't call it genocide , '' she says , boarding the metro to her classes at aydin university . `` we should be ashamed of this and accept it .

      "b\"\\x88+-lrb- cnn -rrb- it was n't until her 20s that fethiye cetin discovered her armenian ancestry . her grandmother , 90 years old at the time , told cetin that her real name was heranus . like many other survivors of 1915 , heranus assimilated and kept her identity hidden . many feared a repeat of the horrors they witnessed and barely escaped . in a crowded reception before a memorial concert in istanbul this week , people rushed to greet fethiye cetin . a strong , soft-spoken woman now in her 60s , cetin is a prominent lawyer who represented armenian-turkish journalist hrant dink . dink was a strong proponent of reconciliation between turks and armenians who was tried for `` insulting turkishness . '' he was assassinated in 2007 . the shocking discovery of her true heritage would change cetin 's life . she tells heranus ' story in an evocative memoir titled `` my grandmother . '' heranus and her family were among a massive stream of women and children being forcibly marched by ottoman soldiers , not knowing where they were going or why they were torn away from their male relatives . echoing throughout the procession were morbid whispers that the men and teenage boys had all been killed . heranus was 9 at the time . an officer spotted her and her brother and wanted to take them away . her mother protested but she was told by others , `` the children are dying one by one . no one will make it out alive from this march . if you give them , their lives will be saved . '' heranus and her brother were scooped up onto the officer 's horse and taken to a garden packed with other children and fed the first warm meal they had had in days . but soon reality set in and heranus began to cry and beg to see her mother . heranus was separated from her brother , adopted by the officer and his wife , who could not have children of their own . her name was changed to seher and she was raised muslim . and so she survived , had children and grandchildren . cetin was in law school when her grandmother revealed her secret and painful memories of her armenian roots . it shattered all that she knew to be real . the 1915 forced deportations and massacres were not taught in turkey 's schools . `` there was a huge silence '' cetin said . `` it was not just the victims that were silent ; it was all of society . '' cetin felt rebellion welling up inside her . `` i wanted to go on the streets and scream that they are lying to us , '' she remembers , `` a cruelty like this happened , and i wanted to shout it out loud . '' armenia and the armenian diaspora have been doing exactly that and demanding that the `` great catastrophe '' be recognized as genocide by turkey and the world . armenian president serzh sargysan said earlier this year that `` impunity paved a path to holocaust and genocides in rwanda , cambodia and darfur . '' the survivors of 1915 and witnesses remember massacres , bloodied rivers , concentration camps , rape and death marches into the syrian desert . the republic of turkey has always rejected the term `` genocide . '' rather , the ottoman empire 's committee of union and progress believed armenian nationalists to be collaborating with the russian army , which was at war with the ottoman empire . to prevent this alliance and stop violence against civilians , the committee undertook a policy of `` relocation '' to move armenian populations residing in or near the war zone to southern provinces . turkey argues that wartime conditions , famine and internal conflicts led to the death of millions of ottomans , including armenian subjects . but it 's only in the last decade that public dialogue in turkey began . `` we just started breaking the silence recently '' , cetin said . `` people were quiet for 90 years in this country . '' turkish leaders have recently taken a more reconciliatory tone . turkish president recep tayyip erdogan offered turkey 's condolences last year to the descendants of the armenians who lost their lives . he called for the establishment of a joint historical commission in order to study the `` events '' of 1915 . but pope francis ' use of the word `` genocide '' and the european parliament 's resolution last week angered turkish leaders . the ministry of foreign affairs called the resolution `` selective and one-sided , '' claiming it repeated `` anti-turkish clich\\xc3\\xa9s . '' erdogan deemed it a `` hostile campaign against turkey . '' this week , turkish prime minister ahmet davutoglu repeated the call for a historical inquiry and the need for an approach based on `` just memory '' for a `` common peaceful future . '' he asked that third parties , such as pope francis , refrain from `` aggravating age-old wounds . '' a century on , cetin says the dynamism surrounding the 100th anniversary excites her , bringing together artists , musicians , scholars and intellectuals as well as turkey 's citizens of all ethnicities and armenians from across the world . if the government were to acknowledge 1915 as a genocide , it would speed up the reconciliation and healing process , she says . `` but if it does not face genocide , then it does not matter . society coming face to face with it is more important . '' still cetin remains hopeful that turkey will accept its moral obligation towards history and its people . as an armenian turk , cetin has helped others retrace their roots and look for long lost answers . but for many , the emotional journey remains unfulfilled as long as turkey denies the cause of their pain .\\xa4\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd1.-lrb- cnn -rrb- for years , when i 'd tell new friends i was half-armenian , a puzzled look would cross their faces , before they 'd ask something like , `` do you have a country ? '' or , when there was a spark of recognition , they 'd chortle , `` ah , you 're the people with the last names all ending in ` ian ' ! '' in fact , one of our most famous armenians , cher , was better known for her oscar-winning portrayals of italians , and had dropped her own identifying surname . the decimation of our people , too , was reduced to a footnote -- if we were lucky -- in tomes about world war i , when more than one million armenians were killed during the last days of the ottoman empire . most of the time , though , the coverage was about how armenians and turks hate each other like cats and dogs , that the turks continue to deny that ethnic cleansing occurred , saying the armenians had hatched a rebellion , and that the leaders had no choice but to deport them from their homes and put them on the road that led to their deaths . even adolf hitler had brushed us aside , uttering , just before invading poland in september 1939 : `` who , after all , speaks today of the annihilation of the armenians ? '' according to the former bureau chief of the associated press in berlin , louis lochner . apparently he had n't the anticipated the kardashian juggernaut . as kim kardashian , sister khloe and their two cousins recently toured armenia -- on the eve of the 100th anniversary of the mass killings , which is marked on april 24 -- they spotlighted a humanitarian crime that pope francis recently called `` the first genocide of the 20th century . '' suddenly , the poor landlocked country of armenia was trending . standing in front of the statute of `` mother armenia , '' kim seemed to seize the label herself , and the adoring crowds appeared to agree . on another stop of her tour , she dressed in a red jumpsuit , and placed tulips at the slate gray armenian genocide memorial complex , bringing new color to an issue and to a people who usually pay tribute to their dead relatives every year in their best funereal black . after the kardashian trip to armenia , my elderly mother anahid called me nearly breathless with pride : `` have you seen ? the genocide is all over the news ! that famous lady , kim kardashian , has done it ! '' my mother 's own father , stepan miskjian , with his own `` ian '' surname , had narrowly survived the killings . he told of how an entire caravan of thousands was killed in what 's now eastern syria , and that he only escaped by waiting until night and crawling out on his hands and knees past the ring of guards , and then crossing the desert for six days with only enough water to fill two cups . when the kardashians first rose to fame , many armenians cringed over their potboiler storyline , their million-dollar weddings to basketball players and rappers , multiple divorces , and a clothing line at sears . through their fame , though , people began to learn about armenians -- even people outside los angeles , where the armenian population is as thick as the kardashian hair . that americans may also have been equating the ancient culture with the latest `` keeping up with the kardashian '' plotline was a source of discomfort for the community . but every once in a while , kim kardashian would tweet something about the issue -- and slowly the community began to warm to her . meanwhile , many armenians continued to brainstorm about how to convince turkey to acknowledge the truth about what happened , and how to persuade the president barack obama to label the killings `` genocide , '' as he promised when first campaigning for the highest office . we cheered and forwarded emails every time a rumor surfaced that steven spielberg was going to take one of our family stories to the big screen , give us our own `` schindler 's list , '' and hoped maybe now the world would be forced to listen . and we would deflate when it would n't come to fruition . and every april 24 , the day in 1915 when ottoman turks began rounding up the community 's intellectual leaders , we mobilized . and we will do so again this year , holding candlelight vigils , concerts , and protest marches , while waving the armenian flag , even though many of us have never been to the country ourselves . we also press forward on the academic front , holding conferences on the latest research around the world , exulting in the discovery of yet another bit of information that would surely make the world reckon , that would counter turkey 's steadfast pressure on the united states to not acknowledge the atrocities . and still , disappointingly , early reports surfaced yet once more , as in years before , that obama has decided again on this year 's anniversary not to use the g-word . despite all the setbacks , the armenians will continue to speak out , and hopefully find some hallowed ground , too , to stand with turks to heal . after all , we 've learned an increased dialogue can come from the most surprising places . this year , it took a reality star , famous for balancing a cocktail on her rump , to catapult it to the top of the news once again , like it was on december 15 , 1915 , when headlines like `` million armenians killed or in exile , '' splashed across the new york times and other international media . after a century of trying to raise awareness , what we needed all along was a television and internet persona to join us -- especially one who shares everything on every platform -- to shed light on a crime that occurred back when telegrams were the speedy form of communication , and photographic plates of the killings had to be smuggled out in a belt , rather than blasted instantaneously with a tweet . the queen of the selfies has finally used her attention for good , and hopefully it wo n't be as short-lived as some of her other memes . that 's a crusade i can follow in any medium .\\xa7\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x92'-lrb- cnn -rrb- fifty years ago in frankfurt , german prosecutors tried 22 former nazi ss soldiers at auschwitz in what remains the most famous holocaust trial staged in germany . at the time , fritz bauer , the german-jewish attorney general of hessen , expressed the simple hope that `` sooner or later , one of the accused would step forward and say : ` what took place -- it was horrific , i 'm sorry . ' then the entire world would exhale , as would all the survivors of those killed at auschwitz , and the air would be cleared . '' sadly , bauer observed , `` it has not been uttered , nor will it be . '' the refusal of perpetrators to own up to their guilt remains one of the most disappointing aspects of holocaust trials . john demjanjuk , whose conviction by a munich court in 2011 established the precedent that has now made possible the trial of oskar gr\\xc3\\xb6ning , remained defiantly silent during his 18-month trial , never so much as breathing a word of acknowledgment or remorse . over the years , some defendants have acknowledged knowing of the exterminations , but have insisted that they played no role . those who acknowledged participating in the killing insisted that they did so out of fear of life or limb . over the years , an extraordinary research effort was dedicated to exploring the claim that ss men had engaged in extermination out of duress . the results were astonishing : investigators and historians failed to uncover so much as a single instance in which a german officer or nco had been executed or even severely punished for opting out of genocide . not one . these evasions and lies were often effective , as many german trials of holocaust perpetrators ended either in light sentences or outright acquittal . and even when a trial ended in a conviction , what was missing was any sense of moral reckoning , an acknowledgment on the part of the accused of the perversity of genocide . fritz bauer can now exhale . on april 21 , on the opening day of his trial in l\\xc3\\xbcneburg , where he stands accused of complicity in the murder of 300,000 jews during his service at auschwitz , the 93-year-old gr\\xc3\\xb6ning faced the court and acknowledged , `` it is beyond question that i am morally complicit . this moral guilt i acknowledge here , before the victims , with regret and humility . '' if nothing else comes from the trial , that statement alone justifies the undertaking . of course , in acknowledging his moral complicity , gr\\xc3\\xb6ning fell short of confessing legal guilt . indeed , for years he has insisted in his innocence as a matter of law , arguing , in an interview with der spiegel in 2005 , that he had been no more than a `` cog in the gears . '' at auschwitz , gr\\xc3\\xb6ning was responsible for inspecting the luggage of deportees to the camp -- most of whom were gassed within hours of their arrival -- for banknotes that would be carefully counted and sent to berlin . in performing this task , gr\\xc3\\xb6ning insists that he never engaged in cruel , murderous or sadistic acts -- a claim that we can probably accept as true . but does this relieve him of criminal liability ? for decades german courts held that mere service as a concentration camp -- in the absence of evidence of a personal act of killing -- constituted no crime under german law . in 2011 , the demjanjuk conviction changed that . in convicting demjanjuk as an accessory to the murder of 28,000 jews at the sobibor death camp , the munich court concluded that death camp guards , regardless of how they had conducted themselves , had to be accessories to murder , because that was their job . it was a crucial breakthrough , because it recognized that mass killing is not a personal act of evil but an exterminatory process . when it comes to factory-like genocide , guilt is not to be measured by acts of cruelty or nastiness ; guilt follows function . convicting under that theory was the great accomplishment of the munich court . by this standard , gr\\xc3\\xb6ning 's truthful claim that he was no more than `` a cog '' constitutes an admission of guilt . this does not mean that gr\\xc3\\xb6ning deserves the same measure of punishment as an ss sadist . in fact , it 's not clear that he deserves any punishment besides the symbolic gesture of conviction . but without the court 's conviction , gr\\xc3\\xb6ning 's important acceptance of moral guilt will remain incomplete . the significance of gr\\xc3\\xb6ning 's trial can be measured in one final way . many have observed that it coincides with the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii . but it also coincides with an anniversary of a different sort . april 24 marks the day that millions mourn the killing of hundreds of thousands of armenians by the ottomans during world war i , an event many have described as genocide . and yet the turkish nation itself remains in denial of the mass killings that unfolded a hundred years ago . with that in mind , gr\\xc3\\xb6ning 's trial reminds us of other mass atrocities that still await their moment of moral and legal reckoning .p\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x8c--lrb- cnn -rrb- protests are gaining steam in baltimore after a man died from a devastating injury he allegedly suffered while in police custody . demonstrators have vowed they 'll keep taking to the streets until they get justice . to start , protesters say they 're looking for answers about what happened to freddie gray , and why . but it seems like the questions in the controversial case just keep growing . protesters rallied at baltimore city hall on thursday , and another march is planned for saturday . here 's a look at key issues protesters are asking about : . police say when gray saw police on april 12 , he started running . within minutes , they caught up with him and arrested him after finding a knife in his pocket . protesters have echoed the claims of the gray family 's attorney , who argues that police did n't have any probable cause to pursue him , but chased him for `` running while black . '' baltimore police union attorney michael davey told reporters wednesday that officers had every right to chase gray . `` there is a supreme court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area , and you flee from the police unprovoked , the police have the legal ability to pursue you , and that 's what they did , '' he said . `` in this type of an incident , you do not need probable cause to arrest . you just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop . '' an autopsy says gray died from a severe spinal cord injury . his family says his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and later died . police say they spotted gray , gave chase , caught him , cuffed him and requested a `` wagon '' to transport him in less than four minutes . the transport van left with gray about 11 minutes afterward , police said , and another 30 minutes passed before `` units request paramedics to the western district to transport the suspect to an area hospital . '' protesters want to know exactly what happened in those 30 minutes , and say it 's clear police used too much force when gray was in their custody . investigators still have n't said what happened inside the van . union officials from the fraternal order of police lodge 3 say something happened inside the vehicle , but they do n't know what . baltimore police commissioner anthony batts told cnn affiliate wjz that another prisoner inside the van said he did n't see any harm done to gray . `` what he has said is that he heard freddie thrashing about , '' batts said . `` the driver did n't drive erratically , was n't slamming on breaks , was n't turning corners fast or in an irrational way . '' five of the six officers involved in gray 's arrest have provided statements to investigators , the baltimore police department said wednesday . `` they have completely cooperated with the investigation from day 1 , '' davey told reporters . but details of what the officers said have n't been released yet by authorities . neither have the officers ' personnel records or photos . police say doing that would violate the law . the lack of details a week and a half after the incident is fueling cries from the public , and the lawmakers who represent them . protesters say police should be releasing what they know now . baltimore police officials say they 're being as transparent as they can about the case while their criminal investigation is ongoing . and they say they plan to hand over details from the investigation to the state attorney 's office next week . some protesters say the officers should be charged with murder for gray 's death . officials say an investigation is ongoing , and all the officers involved have been suspended with pay . at this point , it is n't clear whether any charges will be filed . the u.s. justice department is also investigating the case . the police union said it 's 100 % behind the officers and compared protesters to a lynch mob , accusing them of calling for charges against officers without knowing the facts of the case or giving them a day in court . `` there is , at this time , no indication of any criminal activity whatsoever , '' the union 's statement said , `` but our support will not waiver for any reason . '' gray 's case is getting a lot of attention . but protest organizers say it 's emblematic of a broader problem . some protesters say it 's not the only time they 've seen police brutality on the streets of their city . long before they took to the streets to demonstrate over gray 's death , some of them had already been at city hall , voicing their concerns over other cases . `` right now there 's a lot of mistrust . they feel it 's us versus them , '' baltimore city council president jack young said . `` it should not be that way and it needs to be fixed . '' according to the baltimore sun , the city has paid more than $ 5.7 million since 2011 for more than 100 cases involving allegations of police wrongdoing . police did n't admit fault in any of the cases . the police union said in a statement on wednesday that the reason for the settlements was simple : city officials believe lawsuits are too costly . `` let us be clear , we completely disagree with this policy , as many of these cases are settled without concern for the facts but , rather , to avoid the high cost of defending a potential lawsuit . we believe that these cases should be decided in court where proper time and attention can be given , '' the union said . `` the ease of settlement , and substantial award amount , has led to the unjustified perception of an increase in brutality complaints .

      "b\"\\xd2(-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's a warm afternoon in miami , and 35-year-old emanuel vega has come to baptist health primary care for a physical exam . dr. mark caruso shakes his hand with a welcoming smile . vega , a strapping man with a thick black beard , is feeling good , but he came to see the doctor today because his wife thought he should -- she even made the appointment . it is free to him under his insurance policy with no co-pay , as most preventive care is under the affordable care act . vega is one of more than 44 million americans who is taking part in a medical ritual : visiting the doctor for an annual physical exam . but there 's little evidence that those visits actually do any good for healthy adults . caruso listens to vega 's heart and lungs , checks his pulse in his ankles and feels around his lymph nodes . he also asks vega about his exercise and sleeping schedule and orders blood and urine tests . as long as everything checks out , caruso asks vega to return for another exam in a year . vega says he definitely will . it was a positive experience for both doctor and patient , and they 're not alone ; 92 percent of americans say it is important to get an annual head-to-toe physical exam , according to a kaiser family foundation poll -lrb- khn is an editorially independent program of the foundation -rrb- . and 62 percent of those polled said they went to the doctor every year for their exam . but the evidence is not on their side . `` i would argue that we should move forward with the elimination of the annual physical , '' says dr. ateev mehrotra , a primary care physician and a professor of health policy at harvard medical school . mehrotra says patients should really only go to the doctor if something is wrong , or if it 's time to have an important preventive test like a colonoscopy . he realizes popular opinion is against this view . `` when i , as a doctor , say i do not advocate for the annual physical , i feel like i 'm attacking moms and apple pie , '' mehrotra says . `` it seems so intuitive and straightforward , and -lsb- it 's -rsb- something that 's been part of medicine for such a long time . '' but he says randomized trials going back to the 1980s just do n't support it . the society for general internal medicine even put annual physicals on a list of things doctors should avoid for healthy adults . one problem , mehrotra says , is the cost . each visit usually costs insurers just $ 150 , but that adds up fast . `` we estimate that it 's about $ 10 billion a year , which is more than how much we spend as a society on breast cancer care , '' mehrotra says . `` it 's all a lot of money . '' and then there 's the risk that a doctor will run a test and find a problem that 's not actually there . it 's called a false positive , and it can lead to a cascade of follow-up tests that can be expensive and could even cause real harm . dr. michael rothberg is another primary care physician and a health researcher at the cleveland clinic . he generally avoids giving physicals . `` i generally do n't like to frighten people and i do n't like to give them diseases they do n't have , '' rothberg says . `` i mostly tell my family , ` if you 're feeling well , stay away from doctors . if you get near them , they 'll start to look for things and order tests because that 's what doctors do . ' '' `` the flip side of that is if you 're not feeling well , do n't keep it to yourself . do n't minimize it . do n't pretend it 's not there , '' he adds . rothberg says he still has patients who always schedule an annual exam . for those patients , he skips the physical aspects of the exam and focuses instead on talking to them about their dietary and exercise habits , possible risks , age-appropriate vaccinations and any screening tests they may need . the guidelines discouraging annual physicals are aimed specifically at asymptomatic adults . dr. david fleming , president of the american college of physicians , says it 's important for elderly patients to be seen on a regular basis , to `` do a full assessment of everything -- how they live at home , if the conditions are safe , are they at risk of falling ? they need a flu shots every year . this is a population where it 's definitely indicated . '' back in miami , caruso is also well versed in the research on annual physicals , but he still believes in them . `` i think having a look at somebody is worth its weight in gold , '' he says . it 's an important part of developing a relationship with a patient , he says , and there have been countless times when he 's found real problems during an exam just like the one he gave to vega . `` what if mr. vega had had a lump or bump that was n't right ? '' caruso asks . `` what if when he had his shirt off , mr. vega said , ` oh yeah , i forgot to mention this spot on my chest , ' and it ended up being a melanoma we discovered early ? '' and vega did end up needing a little help -- he has a bad back that 's landed him in the er several times . caruso was able to link him up with a back specialist to help him manage the problem . kaiser health news -lrb- khn -rrb- is a nonprofit national health policy news service .\\xa6\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' david macdonald , who moved to japan as an english teacher two decades ago , is now the head of youtube spaces for asia pacific . `` youtube is not only cats and dogs on skateboards any more . it 's a place for great content . great high quality content , '' macdonald says . the tokyo space is one of five worldwide available for free to youtube partners , who create content and share ad revenue with the website . `` helping creators find better audiences , more audiences , and just improve their craft , '' macdonald says . anyone can create a youtube channel . the most popular , 25-year-old swedish gamer pewdiepie , has more than 36 million subscribers . many of his videos have a viewership that exceeds popular television programs . youtube has 300 hours of video uploads per minute . the website wants more of those videos to be polished productions . japanese film and tv company toei is partnering with youtube to encourage more japanese samurai dramas -- called jidaigeki . the goal is to attract new subscribers in one of youtube 's biggest markets . `` they 're building sets . we have high quality cameras , high quality sets , high quality actors , '' says bob werley , one of the actors in `` the crawler in the dark . '' werley and fellow actor masa hitokawahata hope their higher quality work will appeal to more of youtube 's one billion users . `` it 's going to raise the bar , '' werley says . `` we 've seen a lot more people wanting to use -lsb- the studio -rsb- , becoming aware of it , getting excited about it . '' if a video goes viral , the financial rewards can be significant . thousands of the most popular youtube creators earn six-figure incomes through ad revenue and sponsorships . a handful earn in the millions of dollars .\\xfe\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc5%-lrb- cnn -rrb- have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time , or thought you were having that long-awaited problem-solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep ? according to neuroscientists john kounios and mark beeman , there 's a reason for that . their book , `` the eureka factor '' , explores the influences at work behind that much sought-after `` aha ! '' moment . research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration , most of us end up suppressing it . the book explains how to clear out mental junk , in order to make way for pivotal revelations . dr. kounios explained : `` insights involve unusual connections . cognitive psychologists call these ` remote associations ' . they are processed mostly in the brain 's right hemisphere . insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness . this is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain 's right temporal lobe . '' `` we wrote `` the eureka factor '' to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other , '' said kounios . `` for example , there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state . however , if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious , then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer . '' `` that said , a positive mood and a broad , expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state , '' he added . following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work . spaciousness helps broaden thoughts . even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention . small , windowless offices , low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible , creative thinkers . relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state . `` emergency '' colors such as red suppress it . surprisingly , dark colors and dim lighting can also be beneficial : by obscuring visual details , they help people think more abstractly . static surroundings encourage static thinking . do n't be predictable . you should sometimes change everyday routines , such as where you go for coffee or your route to work . rearrange your furniture and decor from time to time , at home and in your workplace . hold meetings in a variety of places . make sure to include some nonconformists in your inner circle . unusual people tend to be out-of-the-box thinkers , and their unique outlook might help you attack a problem from a different angle . the threat of a firm deadline will narrow your thinking and inhibit your insight . try and use soft target dates and a flexible schedule to establish a helpful , nonthreatening time frame . rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines , if needed at all , should be vague and mild so they do n't contribute added pressure . a positive outlook will help stimulate a more open mind , one that can process a greater number of ideas . if you struggle to think happy , try focusing on the people and things that bring you joy . to put a twist on pasteur 's famous saying , chance favors the happy mind . when you 're stuck on a problem , take a break to do or think about something very different . expose yourself to a variety of people and places . listen to music or go to a pleasing movie , art exhibit or talk a walk . play a game , dance , do yoga , read . insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places . we all know how important sleep is to our cognitive thinking . the sleep-deprived mind is more likely to fixate on small matters -- an absolute killer to creativity . ample sleep also helps foster the discovery of hidden connections between ideas . insightful thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker , because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that would n't come to you when you 're feeling sharp . if you 're an early bird , you should try doing your creative work at night . if you 're a night owl , try the morning . perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental state can change . it takes a while to sink into an insightful mindset . try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed , freewheeling creative thought . turn off your phone . get rid of the clock . let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will . tips have been extracted from the book `` the eureka factor '' , which has been written by dr. john kounios and dr. mark beeman . how missing sleep can damage your iq . how to make rejection work for you . 7 habits of highly ineffective people .\\x1f\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' unlike some critics , corliss appreciated all kinds of movies -- from the arty drama of ingmar bergman to the epic fantasy of `` the lord of the rings . '' his all-time top 100 movies list , which he compiled with fellow time critic richard schickel , contained everything from `` pulp fiction '' to `` finding nemo '' to jackie chan 's `` drunken master ii . '' `` he savored it all : the good , the bad , the indifferent . except that he was indifferent to nothing , '' zoglin wrote . `` to any fan or friend who would ask whether a new movie was ` worth seeing , ' corliss had a stock , succinct reply : ` everything is worth seeing . ' '' but corliss was not afraid to puncture hype around big movies he found overrated , including `` titanic '' -lrb- `` dead in the water '' -rrb- and even -- blasphemy ! -- `` star wars , '' about which he wrote , `` the movie 's ` legs ' will prove as vulnerable as c-3po 's . '' he also did n't care much for sentimental , uplifting movies that often become mainstream hits and win oscars . `` there are movies whose feel-good sentiments and slick craft annoy me so deeply that i know they will become box-office successes or top prizewinners , '' he once wrote . `` i call this internal mechanism my built-in hit detector . '' a graceful and prolific writer , corliss reviewed more than 1,000 movies , penned many time cover stories and authored four books on film , including `` mom in the movies : the iconic screen mothers you love -lrb- and a few you love to hate -rrb- , '' published just last year . -lrb- it was a partnership with turner classic movies , which , like cnn , is owned by turner broadcasting . -rrb- . some credit him with coining the phrase `` drop-dead gorgeous '' to describe actress michelle pfeiffer in a review of her 1985 film , `` into the night . '' he also cleverly , and subtly , gave away the big plot spoiler of `` the crying game '' by spelling it out with the first letters of each paragraph of his review . born in philadelphia , corliss moved to new york after college and began writing film reviews for a variety of publications before joining time in 1980 . he served as editor of film comment , the movie journal of the film society of lincoln center , for 20 years , was a frequent guest on charlie rose 's talk show and made annual pilgrimages to film festivals in cannes , toronto and venice . `` it 's painful to try to find words , since richard was such a master of them , '' time editor nancy gibbs wrote in a note friday to her staffers . `` they were his tools , his toys , to the point that it felt sometimes as though he had to write , like the rest of us breathe and eat and sleep . it 's not clear that richard ever slept , for the sheer expanse of his knowledge and writing defies the normal contours of professional life . '' he is survived by his wife , mary , a noted film critic in her own right , whom he married in 1969 . people we 've lost in 2015 .\\xa3\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' there are nods to other films , chase observed . the way the scene is cut recalls the final bedroom scene of stanley kubrick 's `` 2001 : a space odyssey , '' with tony seeing himself at the next spot in time . the members only guy going to the bathroom is a nod to the famous scene in `` the godfather '' when michael corleone shoots sollozzo and mccluskey . the scene ends , of course , with tony looking up as journey 's steve perry sings `` do n't stop -- '' and then a cut to black . the public reaction caught chase by surprise . `` i thought the ending would be somewhat jarring , sure . but not to the extent it was , and not a subject of such discussion , '' he said . `` the biggest feeling i was going for , honestly , was do n't stop believing . '' still , if anybody is hoping that chase reveals whether tony survives , they 'll have to keep digging . the end is deliberately uncertain and existential , chase said . `` whether this is the end here , or not , it 's going to come at some point for the rest of us , '' he said . `` i 'm not saying that -lrb- he was killed -rrb- . but obviously he stood more of a chance of getting shot by a rival gang mob than you or i do because he put himself in that situation . `` all i know , '' he added , `` is the end is coming for all of us .

      "b\"\\xd8*-lrb- cnn -rrb- an internal inquiry by the tulsa county sheriff 's office in 2009 concluded that reserve deputy robert bates was shown special treatment and that training policies were violated regarding his role with the agency . bates is the volunteer deputy who fatally shot suspect eric harris instead of stunning him with a taser on april 2 . a harris family lawyer provided documents to cnn from the 2009 inquiry , which also found that supervisors intimidated employees to disregard policies to the benefit of bates . the tulsa county sheriff 's office has not responded to repeated calls for comment from cnn . an attorney for bates , clark o. brewster , told cnn 's anderson cooper on friday that he disputed the findings in the report and maintained that his client had the proper training . bates , 73 , is charged with second-degree manslaughter in the shooting of harris . he pleaded not guilty . bates was working as a reserve deputy for the tulsa county sheriff 's office on april 2 when he was involved the arrest of harris in a weapons sting operation . bates has said he meant to stun harris with a taser after the suspect fled from officers but mistakenly shot harris with a gun instead . bates has said the shooting was accidental . he has apologized to the harris family , as has sheriff stanley glanz . how easy is it to confuse a gun for a taser ? the attorney for the harris family said that bates was n't qualified to be on the force , but received preferential treatment because he 'd made donations to the agency and was a friend of the sheriff . the tulsa world newspaper reported some supervisors in the tulsa county sheriff 's office were told to forge bates ' records and were reassigned when they refused . the sheriff 's office denied the allegations in the newspaper 's report . it also declined a cnn interview to respond to the claims . over the weekend , one of bates ' attorneys released most of his training documents and said they prove bates had proper law enforcement training . however , the records were incomplete . bates ' attorney , brewster , characterized the 2009 memo as something borne out of jealousy by other officers . the allegations made in the report are the result of misunderstandings and misstatements , he said . the memos obtained by cnn show that a `` special investigation '' was launched in july 2009 at the request of then-undersheriff brian edwards . edwards asked investigators to look at two questions specifically : was bates being treated differently than any other reserve deputies , and were any employees pressured by supervisors to aid bates ? the investigation found that some employees felt pressured to sign off on certificates for training that bates had not completed . police caught on camera : the good and the bad . on friday , the tulsa county district attorney 's office said it had received new information -- likely the 2009 memo -- that `` are worthy of further investigation beyond the scope of the manslaughter case . '' the da 's office is reaching out to independent law enforcement agencies to investigate further . contrary to claims by the sheriff 's office that bates had the required training to be in the field , the 2009 memo indicates otherwise . the document names then-chief deputy tim albin -lrb- currently undersheriff -rrb- and then-capt . tom huckeby -lrb- now a major -rrb- as two supervisors who allegedly pressured lower-ranking officers to make exceptions or falsify records for bates . one deputy reported that he was tasked with providing field training for bates . the written policy is that a reserve deputy is required to have 480 hours of training , but that huckeby and albin pressured the trainer to write that bates was qualified after only 320 hours . the trainer , fearing reassignment if he did not comply , signed a memo stating that bates had completed 328 hours of training , and did not elaborate on details of the training . later , the memo was amended by his superiors to read , in part , that bates was `` capable of performing the functions of a patrol deputy . '' the training deputy said he initialed the changes , even though he did n't think bates was properly trained . according to the investigation memo , the trainer said that if he was honest , he would have said bates needed remedial training , and that the reserve deputy was `` not really good at traffic stops or operations . '' the internal investigation only turned up 72 hours of documented training . the trainer maintained that he oversaw 328 hours of training , but that the records were sent not to the records office , but instead to huckeby . brewster denied the claims made by the trainer , and alleged that trainer lost his job in part because of his conduct during the internal inquiry . another deputy said that she signed a driving certificate for bates , even though she believed he had not completed the training . albin asked the deputy to make the certificate , and she did so without questioning him , according to the investigation . the memo lists other instances where bates performed operations that he was n't supposed to , given his stature in the department , but that complaints by other officers were dismissed by supervisors . those who complained about bates , according to the memo , were told to leave him alone or to make an exception , citing that he did a lot of good for the county and was close with the top leaders in the agency .k\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' twenty-two buffalo escaped from the farm on thursday -- half the farm 's stock -- including six that were shot thursday night in rensselaer county , mesick said . one buffalo calf was found dead on a road , hit , and not reported , by a driver , mesick said . mesick has been raising buffalo for their meat since 1973 , he said , with no escape like this before . `` they love to roam , '' he said . `` they love to get in the big field and go like a son of a gun and that 's what they did yesterday . '' the last buffalo were shot 20 miles from the farm , he said . the herd broke through three strands of high tensile barbed wire to escape the farm , and later swam across the hudson river , according to mesick , still surprised . `` they never even had a pond to swim across , '' mesick said . `` i still ca n't believe it .

'' email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com . full physical screening of employees also `` is incapable of determining a person 's motivations , attitudes and capabilities to cause harm , among other limitations . '' `` no single measure can provide broad-spectrum protection against risks or adversaries , '' the report said . `` therefore , risk-based , multi-layered security offers the greatest ability to mitigate risks through the application of flexible and unpredictable measures to protect commercial aviation . '' the tsa and most airports could not afford 100 % employee screening , the report said . only two major airports in the u.s. -- miami and orlando -- require employees to be screened through metal detectors , a cnn investigation found earlier this year . as a result of the report , tsa secretary jeh johnson announced immediate actions , including criminal background checks every two years for all airport aviation workers , screening of airline and airport employees traveling as passengers , reduction of access points to secure areas at all airports and increased random screening of aviation employees . johnson requested the tsa study after a delta air lines ramp worker and passenger at hartsfield-jackson atlanta international airport were arrested in december for allegedly smuggling guns onto flights to new york . since the incident , the airport has hired private security to check the bags of employees when they show up for work and has increased overall security . `` immediately following the incident in december 2014 , tsa increased the random and unpredictable screening of aviation workers at various airport access points to mitigate potential security vulnerabilities , '' johnson said in a statement . sen. charles schumer called johnson 's announcement `` a prompt response and a significant first step to closing the gaping loopholes in airport security , especially with regard to reducing access points and enhancing criminal background checks . '' specifically , the tsa report said employee vetting should be strengthened by `` updating the list of disqualifying criminal offenses , instituting continuous activity monitoring through the inclusion of additional federal bureau of investigation -lrb- fbi -rrb- and dhs data sources , and maintaining a national database of airport employees whose credentials have been revoked for cause . '' in addition , the tsa should expand the collection of domestic intelligence , which would include monitoring social media , and expand national reward programs to encourage employees to report security issues , the report said . `` although there is no perfect security system , the multiple layers -- which can be routinely enhanced or modified -- provide an effective means to secure passengers , employees and facilities , '' the report said . it also recommended increased surveillance of employees who work inside baggage rooms and cargo areas . cnn revealed this month that passengers filed 30,621 claims from 2010 to 2014 for valuables that were missing from luggage . the tsa report agreed with a 2008 homeland security study that found random screening was more cost-effective than mandatory airport employee screening . the committee that conducted the tsa study consisted of representatives from the tsa , airports , airlines , airline pilots , aviation security and law enforcement . rep. john katko , r-new york and chairman of the house homeland security subcommittee on transportation security , said , `` as threats to aviation security continue to evolve , it is critical that the transportation security administration , as well as the airport community , are adequately prepared to mitigate insider threats . i look forward to having a meaningful dialogue with airport stakeholders and the tsa on what can be done , going forward , to improve employee vetting and screening for those with access to sensitive and sterile parts of airports . '' rep. kathleen rice , d-new york , a ranking member of the transportation security committee , said the report makes it clear that the `` tsa must do more to neutralize the insider threat and prevent security breaches like we saw in december . '' `` screening every single employee may not be a cure-all solution , but every single employee should come to work every day with reason to expect that they 'll face random screening and inspections , '' she said . lauren stover , security director at miami international airport , told cnn , `` we support the findings of the committee and agree that there is no single solution in mitigating the insider threat , however we will continue our employee screening program as we believe that physical screening is a critical component to a layered security program . '' cnn 's curt devine contributed to this report .\\x13\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' people on the no-fly list , managed by the fbi 's terrorist screening center , are prohibited from boarding a commercial flight for travel into or out of the united states . the number of people on the list is classified . an official with knowledge of the government 's figures told cnn in 2012 that the list contained about 21,000 names , including about 500 americans . before the change , american citizens and permanent residents who inquired with the government about being denied aircraft boarding received a letter that neither confirmed nor denied their inclusion on the no-fly list . now , they 'll be made aware of their status if they apply for redress , with an option to request further information . `` the u.s. government is making enhancements to the department of homeland security traveler redress inquiry program -lrb- dhs trip -rrb- to provide additional transparency and process for u.s. citizens and lawful permanent residents who have been denied boarding on a commercial aircraft because they are on the no fly list , '' the department of homeland security said in a statement . in cases in which travelers included on the list request to receive or submit more information about their status , the government will provide a second , more detailed response , identifying `` specific criterion under which the individual has been placed on the no fly list , '' according to the court documents . an unclassified summary of that information will be provided `` to the extent feasible , consistent with the national security and law enforcement interests at stake , '' court papers said . those who appear on the no-fly list will then have further opportunity to dispute their status in writing , with supporting materials or exhibits , and will receive a final written decision from the transportation security administration . the 2014 ruling that prompted the policy changes had called for passengers on the list to be given the opportunity to dispute their status before a judge .\\x0b\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe07-lrb- cnn -rrb- when melissa atkins wardy , author of `` redefining girly '' and a passionate advocate for fighting gender stereotypes , heard from a frustrated mom on facebook , she knew she needed to do something . so she shared the mom 's story . in a blog post , wardy told how the mom , veronica of richland , washington , wanted to buy `` big hero 6 '' fabric to make pillows for her two children . the problem ? the fabric did n't include two of the heroes from the movie : the female characters , honey lemon and gogo . so veronica decided to send an email to springs creative , the company that makes the fabric , saying that as a woman and an engineer , she was offended . she got an answer from the company but it did n't help . girl empowerment ads like goldieblox : do they work ? a licensing manager for springs creative responded that the company has found that boys do n't want girl characters on their things . `` eeeww girls ! yuck ! haha , '' the licensing manager wrote . it will come as no surprise that veronica was none too pleased to receive that response . `` i was frustrated and disgusted that a manager , and a female manager too , would laugh off my initial contact with the company . it was unprofessional . so i responded , '' veronica told cnn . she asked that we not use her last name , in order to maintain her privacy . in an email back to the company , veronica wrote , `` by eliminating the women in your fabric design , you are telling boys that it 's ok to think girls are yucky , unworthy and less than a boy . `` you are also telling girls they are unworthy , unwanted and that it 's un-cool to be smart and confident . '' what happened next shows that parents , aided by social media outrage , may have more leverage to combat gender stereotyping in our culture than they realize . and the `` big hero 6 '' example -- along with a similar recent one involving toms , the shoes retailer -- suggests that manufacturers may be finally getting it , too . first , the rest of the story about springs creative and the `` big hero '' fabric : after sharing veronica 's story with her readers and her 6,700 twitter followers , wardy encouraged people to give springs creative a piece of their mind . she also invited them to tweet their own stories with the hashtag #includethegirls . women responded in droves , pointing out how black widow , the female character in the popular `` avengers '' superhero movie franchise , is often excluded from merchandise and how cereal boxes rarely include female characters . `` this sends the direct message to both boys and girls that females are forgettable , unimportant , undesirable . what a horrible thing to teach our children ! '' said wardy , who is also the founder and chief executive officer of pigtail pals & ballcap buddies , a company that makes empowering clothing for boys and girls . `` the prevailing theory is , 1 . boys are the default audience , and 2 . boys wo n't want an item with a girl on it , '' wardy said . `` yet , i talk with thousands of parents every week who say otherwise . '' why trying to make our kids happy can backfire . those parents are clearly making their voices heard . because not too long after veronica received her initial response from springs creative , wardy said she got a call from the company , asking her to post a statement from springs creative on her site . `` it is sometimes difficult to hear negative feedback but the message was clear and we intend to act upon your message , '' the statement read . `` most importantly , springs creative does not condone sexism in any shape or form and does not design products to shine a negative light on females or males . '' the company said it would be talking with disney `` immediately '' about additional designs for `` big hero 6 '' that would incorporate all the characters . `` we would never intentionally offend any segment of the population . we are a strong company with positive morals and values and we respect and see both genders equally , '' said the statement . springs creative told cnn it would have no further comment . veronica said she was surprised the company responded so quickly . `` i do not believe this would have happened without the pigtail pals and ballcap buddies community also raising their voices . '' the real march madness : when will women 's teams get equal buzz ? around the same time , wardy heard from another follower about an issue with toms and wrote about it on her site . on the normally progressive retailer 's web landing page for kids were photos that some parents felt played into gender stereotypes . one photo suggested `` playtime approved '' shoes for boys , and the other , this one on a pink background , included the caption `` little ladies : adorn their feet for spring . '' `` really , toms ? girls are not ornaments we adorn . girls play , too ! '' wardy wrote on her facebook page . two hours later , wardy received a comment from toms on her facebook page , saying that the company completely agrees and that the wording has been changed to now say `` new arrivals for kids . '' `` we 're really grateful whenever our community brings something like this to our attention , '' said doug piwinski , senior vice president , global marketing and communications for toms . `` perhaps as much or more than any other brand , i mean we really listen to our customers in our community . '' so , here 's my question : are the two speedy responses from companies after women spoke out on social media more a sign that companies are truly getting it about gender stereotypes and girl and boy empowerment , or more a sign of the power of parents ? or are they a mixture of both ? how to super bowl #likeagirl . wardy said there 's no doubt that companies are in business to protect their bottom line , and that will always be a motivator . but she said these back-to-back incidents show what can happen when parents make it clear they wo n't buy products from companies that sell gender stereotypes . '' ` be not silent ' is my mantra . speak up ! '' wardy said . `` the success with springs creative and toms and other wins we 've had in the past is an example of the power of parents -lrb- moms and dads -rrb- and children 's advocates aggregating their voices to say , ` enough is enough . ' '' veronica said it 's a sign of the power of parents becoming `` more aware , reactive and using social media to make their voices heard by companies that market to children . '' she added , `` one voice can be dismissed ; the hailstorm of voices collectively can not be ignored so easily . '' it is clear , from these two examples , that parents using their voices online and with their wallets can encourage companies to change . there 's no question that raising awareness about stereotypes helps , said wardy . `` if companies are n't paying attention by now , they most certainly should be . '' pink , princess-y and sexy too soon . do you think more companies are getting the message to include girl characters on merchandise ? share your thoughts with kelly wallace on twitter or cnn living on facebook .\\x0c\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' ahem . yeah . hospitable bunch , huh ? those `` intimacies , '' we are meant to understand , account for sodom 's wickedness . and i guess meant that the town was doomed . -lrb- `` intimacies '' is the term used in my 1991 edition of the new american bible . the revised edition refers to `` sexual relations . '' -rrb- . to protect the emissaries from the mob , lot offers up his virginal daughters . which . ugh . anyway , it does n't work . there apparently are n't enough good men to save sodom , which leads to god destroying yet another population in genesis . oh , and while lot 's chosen family members flee the destruction , lot 's wife turns around and is turned to salt . she had been warned not to look back . after god destroys sodom , lot 's daughters worry that there are n't any men left , so they get their father good and drunk and have sex with him . they need to have children to keep the human race going , the logic goes , i guess . after reading that section , i put my bible down . i could n't read anymore . then i read it again . what was i reading ? what are the morals , the meaning , i 'm supposed to get from these ghastly stories ? this is not the god that i have known for nearly 42 years . it 's not the version of the god i pray to daily . i truly do n't believe in a god that wipes out a town in general because of sexuality . why are they wicked ? i do n't believe that my god that would go after one group -- any group . the god that i pray to does n't punish the `` wicked '' like this . i ca n't comprehend this version of god . i ca n't believe in that kind of god . there were much easier things to write about this week in the pages that i read . but , i want to be truthful with you , my readers . the lot story struck me -- hard . i wish that i had answers for you as to why this happened or how it was written many years ago . but i do n't . it could be that it was a tale told to make sure that people only had sex to have children . or it could be a morality tale for the times . the truth is : i do n't really know . i just know that my faith does n't include the idea of such a punitive god . i now fully understand how you could devote your life to reading and analyzing the bible . and when i read this rough draft to my brother , he said to me , `` you have just hit the tip of the iceberg .

      "b\"\\xcd,-lrb- cnn -rrb- my name is mark goodacre , and i am a professor of new testament and christian origins in the department of religious studies at duke university . i was series adviser and one of many on-camera experts on cnn 's `` finding jesus . '' i also appeared in each episode of the program . viewers were invited to tweet and post their questions on the `` finding jesus '' facebook page during the season finale about mary magdalene . below are some of the most interesting , and my answers to them . they have been edited for style and clarity for this article : . anarie kennedy : the copy we have of the gospel of mary magdalene comes from the second century , but is it possible that the gospel itself could be older -lrb- like first century -rrb- ? goodacre : actually , the copy we saw in the show dates from the fifth century . it is currently located in berlin , germany . although it 's our most complete manuscript , it is missing several pages . there are two other fragments of the gospel of mary , both in greek , and both dating from the third century . it is difficult to date the gospel itself . one of the difficulties is that there are no references to it at all in antiquity . our best guess is that it was written at some point in the middle to late second century . gustavo odr\\xc3\\xada : where can we get a good translation of the gospel of mary magdalene ? goodacre : there are several good translations of the gospel of mary . one suggestion is karen king 's `` the gospel of mary of magdala : jesus and the first woman apostle . '' that book also has good introduction and discussion materials . one thing that is worth adding is that the gospel is not actually called `` the gospel of mary magdalene . '' the term `` magdalene '' does not come at all in the texts we have of the gospel . the heroine is simply called `` mary . '' edward james reeves : i would like to know what really happened to mary magdalene ? where did she go ? who last saw her ? goodacre : this is one of the great mysteries about the character ! she is so prominent at the end of each of the canonical gospels , and the reader is expecting to see more of her and to hear more about her in the rest of the new testament , but there is nothing . she is not mentioned in acts of the apostles , or in paul 's letters , or anywhere else . one possibility is that the early church suppressed her memory and chose not to tell the story of this famous female apostle . but if that is the case , it is surprising that the gospel writers pay so much attention to her in their passion and resurrection narratives . another possibility , and we touched on this in the episode , is that mary died not long after the events narrated in the gospels . perhaps she was a wealthy , elderly widow ? @turnbullteacher : would n't church fathers writing in the second century have written if jesus was married or not ? goodacre : that 's a good question . there is actually nothing in second century writers that says that jesus was married and clement of alexandria -lrb- died 215 ad -rrb- takes for granted that jesus was not married . when the `` gospel of jesus ' wife '' was published in 2012 , it was at first thought that this might witness to a tradition of jesus being married from as early as the second century , but it is now clear that the fragment is a modern forgery . @anna585858 : do you think magdalene is a nickname or reference to mary 's hometown ? goodacre : it 's a good guess that `` magdalene '' refers to magdala , and so her name would refer to her hometown , just as jesus the `` nazarene '' is from nazareth . there are other characters in the new testament who are identified by their hometowns . for example simon of cyrene and joseph of arimathea . you are right , though , that it could be a nickname and that it might not have anything to do with magdala . @allsaintsradio : why was the gospel of mary magdalene left out of the canon of 66 biblical books ? goodacre : this is a tough one because it is not clear that it was ever in contention . the gospel of mary is not even mentioned in any of the extant lists of early christian works . but in any case , the book was probably written too late to have had a chance of competing with matthew , mark , luke and john , all of which are written by the end of the first or , at the latest , the beginning of the second century . further , the gospel of mary 's theology is different from the theology of what became the four canonical gospels . @stephanoledreed : where is it -lrb- said -rrb- that jesus had a wife ? goodacre : there are no ancient texts in which jesus had a wife . the closest we get to the idea is the gospel of philip in which mary magdalene is described as jesus ' `` companion , '' one of three women who always `` walked with the lord . '' the same gospel says that jesus used to kiss her often , but we do n't know whereabouts he kissed her because there is a hole in the manuscript at just that point ! however , the gospel of philip is probably too late -lrb- late second to mid-third century -rrb- to be able to tell us anything reliable about the historical mary magdalene . funding jesus : who bankrolled christ 's ministry ? i would like to thank everyone for their great questions over the last six weeks . sorry that fellow on-camera expert candida moss and i could not get to all of them . thanks too for all the encouraging words about `` finding jesus . '' we are pleased that so many of you have enjoyed and profited from watching it . if you would like to explore these issues in more detail , perhaps i might recommend my podcast , the nt pod , which you can find on itunes or at http://podacre.blogspot.com .\\xd0\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe5&-lrb- cnn -rrb- actress mindy kaling 's brother says that he posed as a black man years ago to get into medical school and that the experience opened his eyes to what he calls the hypocrisy of affirmative action . the revelation comes as vijay chokal-ingam , who is of indian descent , is pitching a book about his experiences as a `` hard-partying college frat boy who discovered the seriousness and complexity of america 's racial problems while posing as a black man . '' on his website , almostblack.com , chokal-ingam says he hatched the plan in 1998 after realizing in college that his grades were n't going to be good enough to get into med school as an indian-american . `` so , i shaved my head , trimmed my long indian eyelashes , and applied to medical school as a black man , '' he wrote on the website . `` my change in appearance was so startling that my own fraternity brothers did n't recognize me at first . '' he says he joined an organization for black students and applied to schools using his middle name , jojo . the plan had some drawbacks , said chokal-ingam , who describes himself now as a `` professional resume writer , interview coach , and graduate school application consultant . '' `` cops harassed me . store clerks accused me of shoplifting . women were either scared of me or could n't keep their hands off me , '' he wrote . `` what started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment . '' he says it worked . despite a relatively mediocre 3.1 college grade-point average and a good-but-not-great score of 31 on the medical college admission test , chokal-ingam claims he was wooed by several top medical schools . he even posts documents on his website to bolster his claims , including an enthusiastic letter from a dean at the emory university school of medicine congratulating him on his `` excellent scores '' on the mcat . but there 's little evidence to suggest his posturing as a `` black '' applicant helped him get into these schools . first , there is no point of comparison : chokal-ingam never applied to medical schools as an indian-american . ultimately , he told cnn he applied at 22 medical schools and interviewed at 11 . he was wait-listed at four schools and got into only one . chokal-ingam eventually attended saint louis university medical school , dropping out after two years . affirmative action has been in the news a lot the past few years , with a 2013 supreme court ruling that tightened how affirmative action admissions programs have to be structured and a 2014 ruling that upheld the university of michigan 's ban on the use of race in admissions . chokal-ingam says his story shows how affirmative action `` destroys the dreams of millions of indian-american , asian american , and white applicants for employment and higher education . '' `` it also creates negative stereotypes about the academic abilities and professional skills of african-american and hispanic professionals , who do n't need special assistance in order to compete with other minority groups , '' he wrote . but a saint louis university spokeswoman disputed the account , telling the huffington post that race never played a role in chokal-ingam 's admission . `` his mcat scores and science grade point average met slu 's criteria for admission at that time , and his race or ethnicity did not factor into his acceptance into the university , '' the website quoted slu spokeswoman nancy solomon as saying . as might be expected , chokal-ingam 's claim has n't gone over well in some quarters . `` how does @vijayingam disprove the benefits of #affirmativeaction when he never gained admission to slu based on it ? '' one twitter user asked . some were more blunt . one said chokal-ingam `` is an idiot . '' `` whatever you feel about affirmative action , let 's consider that one person 's experience over a decade and a half ago -- an experience that ultimately did n't yield any deluge in acceptance letters anyway -- is not really indicative of the current state of college admissions , '' wrote salon 's mary elizabeth williams . `` nor is it necessarily an exemplary window into the complex and mysterious vetting process of elite institutions , '' she added . `` instead , chokal-ingam 's story is one of a successful woman 's brother liberally using her name to drum up attention and controversy . '' chokal-ingam 's sister , formerly of `` the office '' and current star of tv 's `` the mindy project , '' is among those who are n't on board , he wrote on his website . she `` strongly disapproves of my book , '' he wrote , arguing that it will bring shame on the family . but others said they do n't see what all the fuss is about . `` i do n't blame this guy at all he earned the right to get into that school via hardwork and was n't getting it and felt like others were getting what he wanted to so he did what he had to , '' twitter user josephdiano77 said .X\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' think super droughts , rising seas and mass extinctions . yet for all of its importance , i do n't think the 2-degree threshold is as famous as it should be . i 've heard it referred to as the `` north star '' for climate negotiations . meaning : this one little number carries huge importance as a way to focus the world 's attention . it 's so significant that it 's going to be the subject of my reporting for the rest of the year . i 'm calling that effort `` 2 degrees , '' and i need your help to make it work . until 5 p.m. et monday , you can vote on the first story i 'll report for the series . vote using the facebook poll below -lrb- or go here if you do n't see it . -rrb- . tell cnn 's john sutter which of these climate change stories you like best - and he 'll report on the winner . this poll closes monday , april 27 , at 5pm et . # 2degrees . all of those story ideas came from you , by the way . they focus on what a 2-degree world might look like . cnn kicked off this effort with a facebook chat last week . we asked for your questions about climate change and about the 2-degree threshold , specifically . i do n't have all the answers right now . we 'll continue to explore the importance of this number together . but below you 'll find quick responses to seven basic questions about this crucial number . many of them come straight from you , the readers . and i tossed in a couple of my own . if you 'd like to follow this project as it evolves , i 'd encourage you to sign up for the `` 2 degrees '' newsletter . and feel free to ask more questions in the comments section below . they 'll shape the way i spend the rest of the year reporting on this super-critical number . one guy , it turns out . william nordhaus , an economist at yale . nordhaus , 73 , proposed the 2-degree threshold in a 1977 -lrb- 1977 ! -rrb- paper titled `` economic growth and climate : the carbon dioxide problem . '' the estimate was `` crude , but it was a reasonable first start , '' he told me . `` if there were global temperatures more than 2 or 3 degrees above the current average temperature , this would take the climate outside of the range of observations which have been made over the last several hundred thousand years , '' he wrote in `` the climate casino . '' a growing body of research now supports the idea . science has continued to raise red flags about 2 degrees of warming . and that work has led policy experts to conclude that a 2-degree world is something none of us should want . `` you need a judgment call for these things , '' said carlo jaeger , chair of the global climate forum , who has written on the history of 2 degrees celsius . `` and this 2-degree thing was a judgment call that happened at the interface of science and policy . '' germany was first to push 2 degrees as an policy goal , jaeger told me . that happened in the 1990s . later came the european commission , the g8 , the u.s. national academy of sciences and , most significantly , the copenhagen accord , which was signed by more than 100 nations who agreed 2 degrees would be too much . the united states was among the signatories . i 'm going to spend the month of may exploring this question , so look for more on this . but here are some striking facts about what scientists expect a post-2-degree world to look like . these are pulled from reports by the national research council , the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the world bank . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 wildfires in the united states are expected to increase 400 % to 800 % in size . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 hurricanes are expected to become 2 % to 8 % more intense . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 a range of species will be at risk for extinction , particularly amphibians . the ipcc estimates 20 % to 30 % of animals and plants species will be at `` increasingly high risk of extinction '' at or near the 2-degree mark . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the arctic is expected keep melting , losing 30 % of its annual average sea ice . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 certain crop yields in the united states , india and africa are expected to decrease 10 % to 30 % . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 the availability of freshwater is expected to decline by 20 % . so ... not good . and numbers do n't convey the emotional toll . `` i 'm from new mexico , '' said nordhaus , the economist who proposed the 2-degree threshold . `` i love it there , and i know it 's going to be a completely different climate . the trout fishing probably wo n't be as good . the hiking wo n't be as good . these forests may look completely different , or burn down . i love to ski . it 's one of my things i love most . and that 's obviously affected by warming . i love the ocean , and the new england coastline , and it 's in peril . that 's just for starters . '' no one knows , exactly . think of 2 degrees like a sort of speed limit -- or a zone of increased risk . katharine hayhoe , a climate scientist at texas tech , told me that burning fossil fuels is like smoking . how many cigarettes give you cancer ? no one knows , exactly . but the more you smoke , the more you up your risk . and 2 degrees , policy experts agree , is certainly risky territory . plus , everyone hates a fraction . targeting 1 degree of warming is `` ridiculous because you ca n't do it , '' said nordhaus , the economist . `` three sounds too high . and you ca n't have a fraction because it 's too complicated . `` so two is kind of an obvious number . '' the climate already has warmed 0.85 degrees since the industrial revolution . and we reasonably can expect to reach 1.5 degrees simply based on the pollution we 're already putting into the atmosphere , even with `` very ambitious mitigation action '' to reduce carbon emissions , according to a 2014 report from the world bank . some of that warming is `` locked-in to the earth 's atmospheric system , '' that organization says . the impacts of climate change already are being felt . yes , but it wo n't be easy . `` if you want to stay below 2 degrees , you have to reduce emissions at an amazing speed -- to an incredible degree , '' said jaeger from the global climate forum . here 's the best guess for what that `` amazing speed '' might need to look like : cutting greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 % to 90 % by 2050 , said jennifer morgan , global director of the climate program at the world resources institute . `` it depends on how much risk you want to accept , '' she said . some activists , including those from 350 . org and avaaz , which together organized the largest climate change rally in history last year in new york , want to accept less risk than that . `` our position is 100 % clean energy , '' said david sievers , a senior campaigner for avaaz . if we continue burning fossil fuels at the current rate , we could hit 2 degrees of warming before midcentury . scarier still , we could hit 3 to 5 degrees of warming by 2100 . some writers have called for the world to abandon the 2-degree target , saying it 's too ambitious , or even naive . but we need a yardstick to measure progress -- and we need that `` north star '' to help us set goals that actually would be weighty enough to make a dent in this problem . if you think 2 degrees sounds bad , 5 degrees is far , far worse . the ipcc expects a 5-degree world to be characterized by `` major extinctions around the globe '' and a `` reconfiguration of coastlines worldwide . '' just beyond that , at 6 degrees , we 're looking a `` catastro-f *** '' that would be almost `` infinitely costly , '' said wagner , the environmental defense fund economist . `` it 's akin to killing the planet , basically . or society on the planet . '' this much should be clear : something has to change . if we shoot for 2 degrees and end up at 3 , that 's still better -lrb- or less awful -rrb- than 5 or 6 . what 's important is that we maintain a sense of urgency , and keep sight of the goal . please be in touch ! i need your help to make this work . email questions to : climate -lrb- at -rrb- cnn -lrb- dot -rrb- com . subscribe to the `` 2 degrees '' newsletter . follow the project on facebook , twitter and instagram .v\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x84%-lrb- cnn -rrb- is america a nation divided ? and has ohio found a better way to bridge those divisions ? it 's hard not to be concerned with these questions given the constant drumbeat of news about the issues that tear us apart as a nation : immigration , community and police relations , poverty , education and dozens of other crucial matters facing america . adding to our divisions is a harsh public atmosphere where politicians are preoccupied with how they can win the next election or give the best sound bite , and where lobby groups work to protect their narrow self-interests while ignoring a broader vision of what is best for our country . in ohio , we have been able to drive meaningful change on many thorny issues that have held our state back in the past -- social services , criminal justice , economic competiveness , infrastructure -- and i 've enjoyed sharing our state 's winning formula with others in my travels . in 2011 , i returned to public service -- after earlier serving for 18 years in congress in the 1980s and '90s . over the intervening years , ohio had lost its way and was hurting . i felt called to help after knowing that members of 350,000 ohio families had lost their jobs and were looking to get back on their feet . ohio is much stronger today . and that turnaround and success are worth being excited about and sharing . for example , we have gone from 89 cents in our rainy day fund and an $ 8 billion shortfall to now having one of the nation 's strongest state budgets and a nearly $ 2 billion surplus . we 've gone from losing 350,000 private-sector jobs to creating about 340,000 new ones . we 've gone from very high taxes across the board to the largest tax cuts in of any state in america , including tax cuts for the working poor . we 're seeing wages grow faster than the national average and ohio 's unemployment rate drop to the lowest level in more than a decade . getting ohio back on track was n't easy . it required big ideas , going against the status quo and tuning out those who worry only about protecting their own special interests . yes , we have a great success story to tell about our state . and we need to make ohio 's success contagious . the leadership style that helped us turn around ohio is needed in washington , where america 's $ 18 trillion debt ticks higher each day and our congressional leaders would struggle even to pass a resolution saluting mother 's day if it required their action . great leaders are not primarily guided by polls , political parties , focus groups , re-election , special interests or protecting the status quo . instead they bring teams of people together , challenge them to innovate and engage both sides to work together to fashion solutions based on common sense and the common good . as the chairman of the house budget committee in congress in the 1990s , i helped craft the first balanced budget since man walked on the moon . we worked in a bipartisan effort that does n't happen enough . there were , of course , disagreements along the way , but they never overshadowed the shared values we had to guide our work and the shared goal of fiscal responsibility and seeing our country live within its means . given the polarizing issues facing our country , america needs a leader who believes in a common set of fundamental values necessary to bring about change that will unite our country without being blinded by the many distractions that ego , selfishness and power produce . leaders who focus only on themselves and their own good have rejected this value-driven approach and make it impossible to make progress on our most pressing issues such as balanced budgets , tax cuts , welfare reform , border security , immigration and health care . we see it every day . there are certain values that guide great countries : . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 personal responsibility : it obligates us to be accountable for ourselves so we can then do our duty for our families and our communities . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 empathy : it allows us to walk in someone else 's shoes , so that in times of disagreement we might consider for a moment that there might be another , better way that makes all of us stronger . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 teamwork : it sets ego aside and demands that we all pull in the same direction to win . \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 faith : it tells us we are made special in the image of god with unique gifts that enable our mission here on earth . these values allow us to develop policy solutions that solve problems in new and creative ways for the good of all americans instead of producing rhetoric , sound bites and press releases that too often pass for true reform . in ohio we 've implemented this winning strategy . it 's worked there , and it will work for the nation as well .\\xd9\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd3\\x1f-lrb- cnn -rrb- it is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the hillary clinton camp prelaunch : how do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot ? how can the people in iowa and new hampshire get to know the `` real hillary , '' the midwestern methodist ? -lrb- as a friend told me , she 's someone who `` likes to sing ` god bless america ' on new year 's eve . '' -rrb- and how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about ? same questions , no doubt , that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie barack obama , and same questions they asked when , as first lady , she ran for the senate in new york . in that race , she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate new york . in this race , she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at diners , drive-ins and dives -- just like the tv show . -lrb- except guy fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at chipotle . just sayin . ' -rrb- . dining aside , it 's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician . all the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops ca n't mask the houdini-like effort hillary clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her `` scooby-doo '' van is followed by throngs of press . -lrb- i half imagined an o.j. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down i-80 . -rrb- . try as she might to launch with a humble start -- not entitled to anything -- she still is who she is . virtually unchallenged . not to mention famous , accomplished and controversial . in watching it all unfold , it 's hard to underestimate the task at hand . it 's also hard to figure out whether it 's actually going to work . hillary clinton -- and her experienced campaign team -- are disciplined and relentlessly on message . that 's usually a good thing when you 're running a presidential campaign . but when you 're sitting at a community college in iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume -- unprompted -- it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent . -lrb- especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words -- as `` standing up for our country . '' short shrift , it seems to me . -rrb- . maybe it 's that the old lessons of message discipline do n't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create -- at least not with this candidate . the hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline . the ability to understand exactly what you have to say -lrb- over and over -rrb- and then say it as if you have never said it before . and look like you 're having a great time doing it . we like to call it authenticity , but it 's probably not . it 's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas , both of which the voters demand in a president . -lrb- a majority of voters -- 53 % -- say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful , as opposed to someone who has not . -rrb- so there 's this balance : if you 're too much like them , you 're nothing special to vote for . but if you 're too different , you 're not relatable . it 's a balance that does n't come easily to hillary clinton . but she 's not alone . when president george h.w. bush was running for re-election in 1992 , he was facing his own image issues . his populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of new hampshire . bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona , did some town halls , and famously declared : `` message : i care . '' some said he actually read it from a cue card , but he also said this : `` i do n't know what i have to do to convince people here that i really care about this -lrb- the economy -rrb- . i do . '' he lost . to an empathetic i-feel-your-pain bill clinton . and the rest , as they say , is history . or , in hillary 's case , at least trying to make history ..\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' `` i spoke to mr. sukumaran 's mother raji yesterday and assured her the government would continue to seek clemency from indonesian president widodo for both men . `` they have been rehabilitated in a most remarkable way over the past ten years and are genuinely remorseful for their serious crimes . `` nothing can be gained and much will be lost if these two young australians are executed . `` i again respectfully call on the president of indonesia to reconsider his refusal to grant clemency . it is not too late for a change of heart . '' the two australians , convicted for their role in a failed 2005 heroin smuggling plot , tried to challenge the president 's decision earlier this month but lost an appeal for the state administrative court to hear their case . their lawyers have since filed another review at the constitutional court . the attorney general 's office has said they would respect all ongoing court proceedings but insisted the inmates have exhausted all their legal options . australia has repeatedly appealed for clemency for the pair and has unsuccessfully proposed a prisoner swap with indonesia as a way of avoiding their deaths . on saturday , united nations secretary-general ban ki-moon called on indonesia 's government to reverse their decision . `` the secretary-general appeals to the government of indonesia to refrain from carrying out the execution , as announced , of 10 prisoners on death row for alleged drug-related crimes , '' a spokesman for ban said , according to various reports . meanwhile , human rights watch says president widodo `` has an important opportunity to signal indonesia 's rejection of the death penalty by sparing the lives of the 10 people facing looming execution . '' `` widodo can demonstrate true leadership by ending capital punishment as unacceptable state brutality , '' said phelim kine , deputy asia director at human rights watch , in a statement saturday . `` president widodo should recognize that the death penalty is not a crime deterrent but an unjustifiable and barbaric punishment . widodo should promote indonesia as a rights-respecting democracy by joining the countries that have abolished capital punishment .

      "b\"\\x8a7-lrb- cnn -rrb- these are fearful times on the highest mountain in the world . the devastating earthquake that hit nepal on saturday set off avalanches that left large numbers of climbers dead , missing , injured or trapped on mount everest . and aftershocks , including a strong one sunday , are continuing to send snow and rocks thundering down the mountainside , complicating rescue efforts . `` we were sitting here in base camp , feeling the situation was getting better , '' said climber carsten pederson . `` and then suddenly , we felt the aftershock , '' he told cnn on sunday . `` and immediately after the shock , we hear avalanches from all the mountains around us . '' but those avalanches did n't appear to be on the same scale as those that came roaring down on the camp saturday . the base camp on the nepal side of everest is in a vulnerable spot , sitting in a valley surrounded by high himalayan peaks . when the huge , lengthy quake struck saturday , the scores of climbers who had gathered there to prepare for or recover from ascents of the peak had nowhere to run . `` an earthquake that long set off avalanches all the way around us . and they came down -- they were large , they were massive avalanches , '' said jon reiter , an american mountaineer at the base camp . people tried to flee as the onrushing wall of snow , ice and rocks took out large sections of the camp . `` they were trying to outrun the avalanche and you can not , '' said pederson . `` so many people were hit from behind , blown off the mountain , blown into rocks , hit by debris , tents were flying off . '' he said he took shelter behind a large pile of stones . `` i could hardly breathe , but i could stay until the avalanche was over , '' he told cnn . a huge cloud of snow dust billowed hundreds of feet into the sky . `` we all ducked for cover until the cloud passed and then started dealing with the aftermath , '' reiter said . that included at least 17 people killed , dozens injured and many others missing , he said . they are one part of the enormous human toll in nepal and beyond from the catastrophic quake . the many unhurt people at the camp scrambled to help the injured , digging them out of the snow and turning dining tents into makeshift field hospitals . snow that continued to fall made it hard for them to see , hampering their efforts . climbers worked in shifts through the night , nursing the injured as they waited for the weather conditions to improve to allow helicopters in . `` a lot of them are in pretty tough shape , '' reiter said of the injured . the airlifts of those with the most severe injuries began sunday morning after the weather cleared . `` the sun is breaking through the clouds , and the choppers are coming in , '' reiter said . `` we 're pretty grateful . we 're going to get these guys down the hill . '' pederson said that most of the injured people at the base camp had been airlifted out by sunday afternoon . but concerns were growing for the groups of climbers stuck farther up the 29,035-foot -lrb- 8,848-meter -rrb- mountain in camps 1 and 2 . the avalanche was reported to have trapped them above the icefall area , an already treacherous part of the mountain that separates the base camp from camp 1 . `` they 'll have to put a new route in from base camp up through that icefall , '' said jim whittaker , the first american to reach the summit of mount everest . the climbers `` will have to cool it for a couple days , wait until the route is re-established , '' he told cnn . but the frequent aftershocks were making that task more difficult . alex gavan , a mountaineer at the base camp , said sunday on twitter that ropes and other gear were being helicoptered to the people trapped above the icefall . a few of the climbers were taken down by helicopter , but more than 100 were believed to still be up there , he wrote . `` practically , it 's impossible to get them off with helicopters , '' pederson said . `` there are so many people up there . '' amid the struggle to save the living , details started to emerge about some of the dead . among them was dan fredinburg , an american executive at google who had been posting updates about his adventures in nepal on instagram and twitter . his sister , megan , updated the instagram account with a message saying he suffered a major head injury . `` we appreciate all of the love that has been sent our way thus far and know his soul and his spirit will live on in so many of us , '' she wrote . `` all our love and thanks to those who shared this life with our favorite hilarious strong willed man . he was and is everything to us . '' eve girawong , a medic from new jersey who worked on the mountain , was also killed , according to her family and employer . `` on behalf of my family , it is with deep sadness that i write that our beloved daughter , younger sister and best friend has been taken from us today , '' a family member wrote on facebook . `` nong eve girawong was doing the thing she loved doing most -- helping others . words can not describe the heartbreak and pain that we are currently suffering . '' people at the base camp described a grim , chaotic situation after the avalanches saturday . `` it 's a pretty rough scene up here , '' reiter said . he told cnn that he 'd put one dead man inside a sleeping bag and zipped it up . many of those who suffered the worst injuries were asked to write down their names to identify them in case they died , reiter said . the exact number of dead remained unclear . reiter reported 17 ; nima namgyal , a doctor with an expedition at the base camp told cnn that he had seen 14 bodies so far . but an unknown number of people are still missing , buried beneath the snow and ice . the earthquake struck just over a year after an avalanche on everest killed 16 sherpas , the deadliest single disaster on the mountain up to that point . the sherpas , an ethnic group , are famed for their climbing skills and often work as mountain guides . `` this is our job , '' said pasang sherpa , who lost people close to him in the 2014 avalanche . `` so there is always a risk of death . '' reiter was also there last year when that avalanche came crashing down the icefall . he described to cnn at the time the harrowing experience of seeing bodies being removed . the american climber has scaled all of the `` seven summits , '' the highest mountain on each of the seven continents , except everest . this is his third straight year trying to scale the tallest peak of them all . he turned back in 2013 `` because it did n't feel right , '' according to his wife , susan . will reiter try again after witnessing another disaster on the mountain ? `` you would think that he would n't because of this and because of last year , '' susan reiter said from her northern california home . `` but knowing my husband i think he will . i hope not , but i do n't want to hold him back .

'' the welterweight world title fight is likely to smash all revenue records and become the richest bout in the sport 's history , eclipsing the pay-per-view record of 2.4 million viewers for mayweather 's fight against oscar de la hoya in 2007 . speaking when the bout was confirmed in february , pacquiao said : `` i am very happy that floyd mayweather and i can give the fans the fight they have wanted for so many years . `` they have waited long enough , and they deserve it . '' mayweather and pacquiao have been considered the best pound-for-pound boxers of their generation but a host of issues -- including differences over drug testing protocols as well as revenue splits and broadcaster conflicts -- have stopped the two from meeting in the ring . both are coming to the end of their careers and have established interests elsewhere . according to forbes , mayweather , 38 , is the highest paid athlete in world sport . pacquiao , who is 36 , has run for political office in his native philippines .d\\x08\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' photos obtained by cnn from an attendee at a village funeral in cheng ` an county in hebei province show mourners of all ages , including children , watching the performance . the attendee , who asked not to be identified , said he was visiting family during the lunar new year holiday . while he was there , one of the elderly villagers died so he went to the funeral . `` i felt something was n't right , '' he told cnn . `` the performance crossed the line . i had heard about hiring strippers to dance at funerals but had never seen it myself . i was shocked when i saw the strippers . '' he said the villagers said this kind of performance had been practiced for a while . `` they did n't find it shocking or strange . they were used to it . `` they told me , ` what if we ca n't watch -lrb- this kind of -rrb- performance after it gets exposed by the media ? ' '' in some areas of china , the hiring of professional mourners , known as `` kusangren '' is commonplace . these can include performances , although in recent times the dance acts have increasingly tended towards the erotic . china 's ministry of culture issued a statement thursday announcing a crackdown on these funeral stripteases . it said that the ministry had investigated two separate incidents , one in handan city , hebei province , and the other in suqian city , jiangsu province . both involved multiple-participant `` burlesque '' and `` striptease '' shows as mourners looked on . the ministry 's report said that stripteases undermined `` the cultural value of the entertainment business , '' and asserted that `` such acts were uncivilized . '' the practice has been going on for some time , the report said . exotic dancing and other forms of pornography are illegal in china . the dancers in the two cases were held in `` administrative detention '' following the two investigations , the report added . the ministry of culture did not respond to cnn requests for comment . last year , the chinese ministry of public security ordered police across china to step up efforts to tackle the `` three vices '' -- prostitution , gambling and drug trafficking -- warning officials they would be held accountable for illegal activities . in february 2014 , a massive crackdown on prostitution in the southern manufacturing city of dongguan , dubbed `` sin city '' for its huge vice industry , raided 2,000 establishments and detained more than 900 people .\\xe0\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' bruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from : death , or life in prison without any possibility of parole . `` we are asking you to punish jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life . '' showing the court a photo of the federal supermax prison in colorado , bruck said : . `` this is where the government keeps other terrorists who used to be famous but are n't anymore . ... he goes here and he 's forgotten . no more spotlight , like the death penalty brings . `` no interviews with the news media , no autobiography , no messages from jahar on the internet . no nothing . `` no martyrdom . just years and years of punishment , day after day , as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did . `` the evidence will show that if you sentence jahar to a lifetime of thinking about what he did , you 'll both punish him and protect society . '' tsarnaev , 21 , was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him ; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- krystle campbell , 29 ; lingzi lu , 23 ; martin richard , 8 ; and sean collier , 26 . in deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison , jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors , such as his relative youth , mental health and family background , and whether or not he is remorseful . he has shown no emotion as he sits in court , and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead . last week , federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony , including an array of images showing the victims as happy , active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion , screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the forum restaurant , where richard and lu died . lead defense attorney judy clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that tsarnaev and his brother , tamerlan , set off the bombs and shot mit campus cop collier . but she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother . tamerlan tsarnaev , who was 26 , died in a gunbattle with watertown , massachusetts , police three days after the bombings . clarke 's colleague , bruck , began that narrative in his opening statement by noting , `` the man who conceived , planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish . only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left . `` he was 19 , nearly 20 . but he was still at an age still legally too young to buy a beer . and an age when people make horribly bad , destructive decisions . what each of you will have to decide for yourself is how to weigh his young age as a mitigating factor . '' bruck tried to use a photo prosecutors introduced last week -- showing tsarnaev raising his middle finger at a surveillance camera in his federal courthouse cell -- to make his point . `` i could almost hear you gasp '' when that photo was displayed between images of bombing victims , bruck said . `` it turned out that shocking gesture was n't quite as advertised . `` what did he mean ? it meant he was acting as an immature 19-year-old . '' several members of tsarnaev 's family arrived in boston over the weekend , but the defense is closely guarding its witness list . the relatives , who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel , apparently do not include his parents , who divorced and returned to dagestan before the april 15 , 2013 , bombings . court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness janet vogelsang , a sociologist , to explain tsarnaev 's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced russian muslims whose american dream failed . under federal law , the jury 's decision must be unanimous . a deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life . the boston globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20 % of those polled in massachusetts favor the death penalty for tsarnaev . the number is down substantially since the days after the bombings .\\xae\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfd=-lrb- cnn -rrb- for years , warren weinstein 's family frantically searched for details about his whereabouts and pushed for his release . his wife said she was still searching for answers thursday after u.s. officials revealed the 73-year-old american aid worker had been accidentally killed in a u.s. drone strike targeting al qaeda . `` we were so hopeful that those in the u.s. and pakistani governments with the power to take action and secure his release would have done everything possible to do so , and there are no words to do justice to the disappointment and heartbreak we are going through , '' elaine weinstein said in a statement . `` we do not yet fully understand all of the facts surrounding warren 's death , but we do understand that the u.s. government will be conducting an independent investigation of the circumstances . '' gunmen abducted weinstein in 2011 from his home in lahore , parkistan . they posed as neighbors , offered food and then pistol-whipped the american aid worker and tied up his guards , his family said . just a few months after weinstein 's capture , al qaeda leader ayman al-zawahiri released a recording claiming the terror group was holding weinstein -- and demanding , among other things , that the united states end airstrikes in pakistan . u.s. officials called for his release but repeatedly said washington would n't bargain with al qaeda . weinstein -- a husband , father and grandfather from rockville , maryland -- was 73 years old when he was killed , according to a family website detailing information about his case . he worked in pakistan as a contractor for the u.s. agency for international development from 2004 to 2011 , the website says . his employer , virginia-based consulting firm j.e. austin associates inc. , described him as a world-renowned development expert . `` warren spent his entire life working to benefit people across the globe and loved the work that he did to make people 's lives better , '' his wife said thursday . he loved the pakistani people and their culture , she said , learning to speak urdu and doing `` everything he could to show his utmost and profound respect for the region . '' as he announced weinstein 's death thursday , u.s. president barack obama praised what he said was weinstein 's lifelong dedication to service , first as a peace corps volunteer and later as a usaid contractor . weinstein , obama said , was someone who `` willingly left the comforts of home to help the people of pakistan , '' focusing his work on helping families escape poverty to give their children a better life . `` this was a man who basically dedicated his life to service , to people in general , but especially to people in a country where the standard of living was low and difficult . ... it 's tragic that he was killed the way he was , '' former u.s. ambassador dan simpson said . simpson met weinstein in 1968 when they were both working in burundi -- simpson as a diplomat and weinstein as a scholar researching several books . weinstein `` was a very kind person , '' simpson said , `` and someone who was very sensitive to the needs of the people who he worked with . '' another hostage was also killed in the january operation , italian aid worker giovanni lo porto . u.s. officials knew they were targeting an al qaeda compound in the afghanistan-pakistan border region in the january counterterrorism operation , obama said , but they did n't know that the hostages were also there . both lo porto and weinstein were people who `` believed passionately '' that they could make a difference , obama said . `` there could be no starker contrast between these two selfless men and their al qaeda captors , '' obama said thursday . `` warren 's work benefited people across faiths . meanwhile , al qaeda boasted to the world that it held warren citing his jewish faith . '' weinstein 's health had been deteriorating , obama said . last year daughter alisa weinstein told cnn her father suffered from a heart condition and severe asthma . but it was still an optimistic time for the family . that month captors released u.s. army sgt. bowe bergdahl , and that buoyed hopes from weinstein 's family that he could also be freed . `` they have shown with this exchange that they can get this done . if they want to , they can do this , '' alisa weinstein said at the time . `` so i know that they can do it for us and they can do it for others . '' but a prisoner swap never happened for weinstein , even though his family pushed for one . al qaeda released a video of weinstein on christmas 2013 . he appeared gaunt and said he was suffering . `` needless to say , i 've been suffering deep anxiety every part of every day , not knowing what is happening to my family and not knowing how they are and because i am not with them , '' weinstein said in the video . at the time , a former colleague and friend said his appearance in the video was jarring . `` quite honestly , i did n't recognize him in the picture , '' laurie wiseberg told cnn . `` he has changed so dramatically from the person he used to be in terms of appearance and i would hope something could be done so he has a chance to be reunited with his family , his wife , his children and grandchildren , and not have to die in a foreign country far away from those he loves . '' at the time , the washington post also reported that it had received a letter from weinstein . the letter , which was also posted on the website of the site intelligence group , described his background doing human rights work . the letter said that before becoming a consultant in 2003 , weinstein had worked as a college professor at the state university of new york - oswego , as a peace corps country director in togo and ivory coast and for usaid and the world bank . `` i hope that the media can mount a campaign to get the american government to actively pursue my release and to make sure that i am not forgotten and just become another statistic , '' the letter said . `` given my age and my health i do n't have time on my side . '' weinstein 's wife 's statement on thursday thanked some but also blasted the governments of the united states and pakistan for not doing more to help her husband . while maryland members of congress -- rep. john delaney , sen. barbara mikulski and sen. ben cardin -- and members of the fbi were `` relentless '' in efforts to free her husband , she said others in the u.s. government were `` inconsistent and disappointing over the course of 3 1/2 years . '' `` we hope that my husband 's death and the others who have faced similar tragedies in recent months will finally prompt the u.s. government to take its responsibilities seriously and establish a coordinated and consistent approach to supporting hostages and their families , '' she said . pakistani government and military officials also should have done more , she said . `` warren 's safe return should have been a priority for them based on his contributions to their country , but they failed to take action earlier in his captivity when opportunity presented itself , instead treating warren 's captivity as more of an annoyance than a priority , '' she said . `` i hope the nature of our future relationship with pakistan is reflective of how they prioritize situations such as these . '' but ultimately , she said her husband 's captors are the ones responsible for his death . `` i can assure you that he would still be alive and well if they had allowed him to return home after his time abroad working to help the people of pakistan , '' she said . `` the cowardly actions of those who took warren captive and ultimately to the place and time of his death are not in keeping with islam and they will have to face their god to answer for their actions . '' opinion : could weinstein have been saved ? cnn 's elise labott , jim sciutto and pamela brown contributed to this report .\\x08\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd5$kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- the clamor and chaos of the previous day has dissipated by the time we arrive at kathmandu 's only airport . the mad rush of 24 hours previously , in those first confusing , cacophonous hours following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake near the nepali capital , had died down . now , families sit , camped out , silent and patiently waiting , but for now abandoned . at the airport , at passport control , we meet a nepalese man , who is unable to contact his family . they live in a village 20 km from the epicenter . he also has two cousins on everest , he says . he has no way to reach any of them . follow the latest coverage of nepal earthquake . stepping out of the terminal building , the devastation is apparent . it is an overwhelming introduction to this city that , less than 48 hours ago , was hit by the worst earthquake this country has experienced in 80 years . the death toll has skipped past 3,000 and climbs , inexorably . taking into account the fact that many rural areas , just as badly affected but isolated and vulnerable , have yet to be evaluated , the human cost is staggering . across town the bus station is a hive of activity as scores try urgently to leave the city , to make it out to the outlying areas so badly affected by this quake . communications are down and so many here are desperate to make it out to their stricken families , and discover their fate . the scene is repeated at every gas station ; snaking lines of indian-made tata cars , and motorcycles , waiting to fill up . people are clambering aboard buses , into cars , trying to get as far away from this devastation as possible . remaining inside kathmandu , neighbors stare forlornly at their former homes , now collapsed piles of rubble . we visit a montessori school , mercifully empty as the children had the saturday off . a seven-story building behind it , however , was home to a small church , and housed a congregation of between 40 and 50 when tragedy occurred . the pastor 's son nakul tamang clambers up a ladder , looking for an entrance into the ruined facade , looking to retrieve his father , not knowing if he will find him alive or dead . rescue teams stop him before he reaches the top . the building is not secure , but tamang does n't care . `` it 's sad , it 's hard , '' he says . six bodies had already been pulled from the concrete and steel wreckage . a nearby five-story structure has collapsed in on itself . it was pink , with wrought balconies . now it is pancaked , reduced to a third of its height and a mess of rubble and reinforced steel . one woman has been pulled out of the wreckage , and rescuers continue to work in a precarious hollow scooped out from the fallen bricks . officials tell the onlookers that there is a chance that survivors may have been protected in a corridor as the building came down around them . a day after the earthquake struck , they found a woman under the rubble . unhurt ; in shock , but alive . it is this hope that keeps narayan gurung going : the belief that his wife and 7-year-old are still alive . `` i raced here after the earthquake . i have n't slept for days , '' he says . workers dig painstakingly , slowly removing piles of stone and debris . they spot someone 's hair , but ca n't yet reach the body or tell if it 's male or female . wherever there is rubble in this city , there is a police or military presence . they are not necessarily commanding the digs but they keep onlookers from getting too close , or directing traffic as best they can . for their part , the onlookers look shell shocked -- there is little outpouring of grief , no sobbing or wailing , but rather a solemn , dazed , collective sense of disbelief . tundikhel park was , just two days ago , a vast , open green oasis in the city , but is now a mess of tents . some have made their own , the army is setting up others . metal bleacher-style seating has been set up , with dozens of people sitting , waiting , makeshift blue tarp tents pitched underneath . people bring in fresh fruit , and there are water sellers -- although clean bottled water is becoming hard to to find . people queue endlessly for food and water . there is a mobile government field hospital here , and those treated wait listlessly outside , a collection of crushed hands , broken legs , strapped ankles . one little boy was hit by a falling brick . `` i felt something like a fire , and i ran , and then something hurt me a lot . '' he says . `` i am still scared . '' and so is everybody else : those who survived clinging to those they love . arwa damon and gul tuysuz reported from nepal , while euan mckirdy wrote from hong kong .\\x01\\x1e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbe:-lrb- cnn -rrb- on july 20 , 2012 , excited moviegoers gathered for a midnight screening of `` the dark knight rises '' at the century aurora 16 multiplex theater in aurora , colorado . eighteen minutes into the show , and shortly after midnight , a gunman opened fire on the audience . twelve people were killed and 70 were injured . on monday , shooting suspect james holmes goes on trial for 165 counts , including murder and attempted murder charges . he has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity . it 's a moment the survivors and those who lost loved ones have waited for anxiously . it 's a moment that will be a painful next step toward healing and one that will no doubt bring back a flood of painful memories . ahead of the trial , cnn spoke with several people whose lives were changed because of the shooting . they will attend at least part of the trial . pierce o'farrill made a last-minute decision to go to the movies with a friend . o'farrill was shot multiple times and collapsed as he tried to escape . the shooter stood above him , and o'farrill prepared to die . then , the gunman moved in another direction . o'farrill soon saw an officer who told him he was going to make it . kaylan bailey attended the movie with her cousin , jamison , his girlfriend , ashley , and their daughter , veronica . kaylan , just 13 at the time , babysat 6-year-old veronica often . she had watched her earlier in the day when ashley , who was pregnant , had an appointment for an ultrasound . when she heard gunfire , kaylan made a heartrending 911 call . ashley , jamison and veronica had all been shot . veronica was the youngest to die in the theater . ashley was paralyzed and later suffered a miscarriage because of the trauma she suffered . jamison was shot in the head and survived . tom and caren teves lost their son , alex , who was in the theater with his girlfriend . when the shooting began , alex shielded his girlfriend , saving her life and absorbing the bullets that would take his . the teveses remember alex as someone who was fearless , funny and gave the greatest hugs . `` the world had a great person taken out of it that could 've done so much more , '' caren teves said . the teveses launched a campaign called `` no notoriety '' to challenge the media to not show photos or use the name of the shooter . marcus weaver was at the movies with his friend , rebecca wingo . as the gunman opened fire , marcus and rebecca dropped to the ground . during a break in the gunshots , marcus tried to get to the exit , taking rebecca , who was unconscious , with him . the shots started again and it was chaos . marcus had been hit in the shoulder with buckshot , but he made it to an exit . rebecca did n't make it out alive . weaver remembers her as a bright and shining person with a contagious smile . here , in their own words , is a glimpse at what these people are experiencing 2 1/2 years after the shooting and as the trial begins . o'farrill : `` i do n't think the shooting has defined me as a person . but i think what i 've learned from it , the strength that i 've gained from overcoming something this terrible , has become a defining factor of my life . '' bailey : `` i would say that the theater shooting is life-changing , but i do n't think it defines me . '' caren teves : `` the ripple effect from this whole tragedy is just endless . it goes on and on and on . '' tom teves : `` people start to shy away from you , too . because it 's just too painful . and they 're afraid of the fact that you 're a window into the fact that evil exists . because you 're proof that evil exists , not in your persona but in what happened to your child . '' weaver : `` and so as you ask about life , how i see it , i just see it in a different lens . and it took a while to get used to that lens . because i could n't do the same thing i did before . i just was n't that person anymore . i rarely go out to restaurants and stuff . because , you know , people come up to you and start talking about it . ... `` i do n't think anybody who was in that theater that night will ever be the same . '' o'farrill : `` we woke up today , we got out of bed ; this was the day that the lord promised us . but he certainly has n't promised us that ... we 'll live to see another one . so for me , just living in gratitude and being grateful for every moment i get has been key to my healing . '' caren teves : `` it does n't get any easier . you just learn to fake it better . ... you get stronger carrying the weight . '' weaver : '' ... just like my arm 's going to heal , so will i. and we 'll all move past this . and we 'll get stronger . '' o'farrill : `` i do hope to meet him someday . it 's something that 's been on my heart since the shooting happened . and i hope to meet him and just tell him in person , ` look , you know , you tried to kill me but i do n't hate you , and i forgive you . and there 's only one way that 's possible and that 's through jesus . ' '' bailey : `` no , i do n't forgive him . he took so many people 's lives , and he hurt so many other people that were n't even in the theater . he hurt families and friends and just everybody in aurora , honestly . '' caren teves : `` as far as forgiveness goes -- normally , i will forgive someone who asks for forgiveness . in this case , i have n't had anyone ask for forgiveness . '' tom teves : `` god will forgive anyone who asks for forgiveness . but that also means that you have to stand up and take responsibility for your actions . '' weaver : `` there 's no doubt about it . i forgive him . i really do n't even think about him that much at this point ... i just did n't want to carry that bag of rocks on my back anymore . '' o'farrill : `` the trial starting , i think , will kind of stir things up . and it 's been something i 've really been trying to prepare myself for , you know . talking to my counselor about it and praying on it daily , and understanding that , again , i ca n't control how it all unfolds , you know . but i can be prepared for it . '' bailey : `` i 've never been involved in something so serious . i do n't think it 's hit me . i do n't think i realize what i 'm going into . '' tom teves : `` it does n't bring these emotions to the surface again for us . these emotions never leave for us . '' weaver : `` you start thinking about being on that stand . you start thinking about seeing the shooter right there . you start thinking about -- just all kinds of things and what 's it going to be like . and it just races in your head , if you let it , you know ? so part of the coping skills is you just do n't let it . go do something different . go exercise . go hang out with your wife . '' o'farrill : `` whatever punishment james holmes receives is not going to be part of my closure . i certainly understand that other folks are looking forward to that and that 's their path . but we all have different paths to healing . '' bailey : `` so , like , i do n't think that if he does get the death penalty , then , i 'll , i do n't know how to word this . i wo n't be happy because that 's another person 's life . but i think he deserves it . '' caren teaves : `` the only justice , for me ... is if that thing was in an urn on my dresser , and alex was sitting next to us on this couch . that 's the only justice . '' weaver : `` although i 'm not a death penalty person , if the death penalty was ever warranted in any case , it 's this case . ''\\xeb\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' it all highlights the more proactive role taken by india in recent months . just weeks ago , india flexed its military muscle to rescue indians and other nationals from conflict-torn yemen . now , it is taking the lead in nepal . some might say india 's friendship is a signal for the other big country that shares a border with nepal : china . a display of hard power , perhaps to achieve enduring soft power in the region . but in times like this , help is always welcome . first there 's the immediate search and rescue operation , and then the long process of rebuilding work . nepal will need india 's friendship -- as well as china 's -- for many long months ahead .\\xcf\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x802-lrb- cnn -rrb- please , not even a demonstration . freddie gray 's family had asked there be quiet on baltimore 's streets the day they laid him to rest . and above all , no violence . raging hordes turned a deaf ear to that on monday . but a handful of people repeated the family 's message . they became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police , breaking windows , looting and setting fires . the peacemakers -- clergy , gray 's family and brave residents -- placed themselves in the rioters ' way . their message was the same . `` i want them all to go back home , '' said rev. jamal bryant . `` it 's disrespect to the family . the family was very clear -- we 've been saying it all along -- today there was absolutely no protest , no demonstration , '' he said . but the messengers were a finger in a dam that quickly crumbled , as rowdy groups swelled into a full urban riot . it overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days -- justice for gray . the 25-year-old african-american man died from spinal injuries after being arrested earlier this month . the early fits of violence came in the afternoon , about the time mourners left gray 's memorial services blocks away , rev. bryant said . they bumped right into it . `` for us to come out of the burial and walk into this is absolutely inexcusable , '' he said . he did not want to see it spread to downtown baltimore , where some rioters said it would , and organized people to stand in the way . `` we have a line of gentlemen from the nation of islam to build a human wall , as well as men from the christian church making that human wall , '' he said . but as crowds turned into multitudes , the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare , and police lines were also no match . as officers in riot gear receded , flames engulfed cars and stores and roared out of apartment buildings into the night sky . a senior living facility under construction by a baptist church burned to the ground . the blazes stretched the fire departments ' resources , as at least 30 trucks deployed . looters streamed into a cvs , bodegas and liquor stores and walked out with what they could carry . a young man in a blue sweatshirt tried to talk people down by himself . he walked up to cnn correspondent miguel martinez , as a store nearby was being looted . it later went up in flames . the man , who did n't say his name , was disgusted at what was happening in his neighborhood and disappointed in the police response to rioting . there was a line of police down the street , not far away . `` they could have moved down here to stop it , '' he told martinez . the gray family 's lawyers , again , put the family 's wish out to the public that there be no protests that day , let alone violence . it 's marring the cause and hope for change that may have come out of the investigation into freddie gray 's death , said family attorney mary koch . `` that 's just disintegrated into just looking at baltimore city and thinking that the city is the city of violence , '' she said . against all odds , a handful of individuals kept trying to stop it . a tall , adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police . he slung an arm over his shoulder , turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines . but as they strolled past a crowd , a young man behind them hurled a stone at police , putting his whole body into the throw . at least one young man paid the price for his participation , when his mother turned up to spank him home . before running cameras , she slapped him in the head again and again , driving him away from the crowd , as she cursed . police commissioner anthony batts later thanked her . `` i wish i had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight , '' he said . after night fell , giving way to a 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles , robert valentine stood alone with his back to a line of police in riot gear . he shooed away young people tempted to approach them . `` go ! step your -- ss away ! '' `` i 'm just a soldier , '' said valentine . he told cnn 's joe johns that he was a veteran of the vietnam war . young people had no business on the streets , he said . `` they need to be in their home units studying and doing something with their lives . '' even baltimore members of the crips and bloods , two street gangs renowned for drug dealing and extensive violent crime -- and for killing each other -- came together with others who condemned the rage that swept through their neighborhoods . `` the guys who pulled me aside are self-identifying as crips and say they do n't approve of whats happening . ` this is our community , ' '' wrote baltimore sun reporter justin fenton on his confirmed twitter account . gangs members joined community leaders and gray 's family for a press conference monday night on the stage at new shiloh baptist church , which had held gray 's funeral . an announcer thanked them for coming to the church . the gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests , according to a report by the daily beast . rev. bryant also mentioned their peace treaty . but police say the gangs ' purpose goes much further -- that they and another gang called the black guerilla family plan to ` take out ' law enforcement officers , police said . `` this is a credible threat . '' the gangs are consistently pursued by the fbi . at the end of the day , gray 's family had the last word on the violence at the press conference . it was n't good . `` to see that it turned into all this violence and destruction , i am appalled , '' said richard shipley , gray 's stepfather . `` i want y' all to get justice for my son , but do n't do it like this here , '' said gray 's mother gloria darden , who wore a t-shirt with her son 's photo . `` i do n't think that 's for freddie , '' his twin sister fredericka gray said . `` i think the violence is wrong . '' after their comments , gray family lawyer william h. murphy took the microphone . violence is not the path to change , he said . then he got back to the message than had been bitterly marred by the rioting . murphy asked for a show of hands in the church audience of people who had experienced police brutality or personally knew someone who did . all but a few hands went up .\\xde\\x04\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xdd\\x11-lrb- cnn -rrb- a professor at texas a&m galveston said in an email to his strategic management students that they were a disgrace , that they lacked maturity -- and that he would fail the entire class . irwin horwitz , an instructional associate professor in the university 's department of maritime administration , told cnn affiliate kprc that he had finally reached a breaking point . `` enough was enough , '' horwitz said . `` it became apparent that they could n't do just some of the most simple and basic things that they should 've been able to do at that point . '' in the email to students , kprc reported , horwitz said : `` i have seen cheating , been told by students to ` chill out , ' ` get out of my space , ' ` go back and teach ' refuse to leave the room after being told to do so following inappropriate conduct , called a ` f ***** g moron ' several times by a student to my face ... '' horwitz added that students spread hurtful rumors about him , his wife and colleagues , and that he felt the need for police protection in class . john shaw , a senior at texas a&m galveston and student in horwitz 's class , told kprc he was worried about the job he has lined up after graduation . `` just ridiculous , because , i mean , i had never had a problem in the class , '' shaw said . `` i thought i had done pretty well , done pretty well on the first test and everything else that 's going on . i get an email saying i am going to get an f in the class , and just kind of -- it was overwhelming . '' texas a&m galveston is a part of the texas a&m university system ; its more than 2,000 students focus on marine and maritime studies . patrick louchouarn , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer , told kprc that the university will not necessarily stand by the failing grades horwitz planned to hand out . university officials said the department head will take over teaching the strategic management class . `` none of them have failed until the end of the class , meaning the only reason a student would fail is because he or she has n't performed the actual , you know , with the expectations for that particular class , '' louchouarn said . university officials have not yet responded to cnn 's request for comment .\\x91\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche . `` remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help , '' he said . `` we are victim ourselves . ... despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down , we are trying to build morale , maintain morale and help themselves . '' thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend . `` children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime , '' he said . dhakal , the home ministry spokesman , put the death toll at 4,620 , while nepal 's national emergency coordination center said the number of dead was 4,727 . both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239 . another 72 people died in india , while china reported 25 deaths . most of the casualty numbers in nepal are believed to have come mainly from kathmandu and the surrounding area . they are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas . `` we have incomplete information , but we apprehend the death toll will go up , '' nepalese information minister minendra rijal told cnn earlier on tuesday . `` we can not say by how much exactly . '' the news agency reuters cited prime minister sushil koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was `` on a war footing '' in its rescue and relief work . in a live , televised address to the nation , the prime minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning , starting tuesday . the government 's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts , he said , as he thanked all those involved . historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time , he added . at least 90 % of 96,000 nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations , according to nepal army spokesman jagadish chandra pokharel . more than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help , koirala said , as he appealed for other nations also to come to nepal 's aid . even as international aid pours into the country , overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies , people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake 's epicenter . `` the biggest problem is reaching these villages , '' matt darvas , an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group world vision , told cnn from gorkha district , northwest of kathmandu . nepal struggles to cope with international aid . nepali home ministry joint secretary sagar mani parajuli , who is coordinating relief efforts , said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather , which limits the use of helicopters . `` the helicopters are small . they do n't fly in windy and cloudy conditions . given nepal 's geographical terrain , we can not use surface transport much but are using it , '' he said . `` we need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins , but we do n't have enough of them . '' jamie mcgoldrick , the u.n. resident coordinator for nepal , told a news conference tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because kathmandu 's international airport , which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park , is log jammed . the united nations is aware of the request for tents , he said , but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains . of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of nepal , some 1.4 million need food aid , mcgoldrick added . nepal 's population is about 31 million . at an event in paris , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of nepal and called the humanitarian needs `` huge and urgent . '' `` the united nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts , '' he said . `` i count on the generosity of the international community in nepal 's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed . '' a cnn team that joined a nepalese military helicopter flight to dhulikhel , a rural area east of kathmandu , saw extensive damage in the kathmandu valley from the air , including many landslides . on landing , the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought . more than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets . social media posts from nepal . darvas of world vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding gorkha district , which is near the earthquake 's epicenter . they included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70 % of the houses had collapsed , trapping and crushing the people inside , most of them children and the elderly . even though aid groups and nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across nepal 's mountainous terrain , they face daunting challenges getting help to them . `` some of those villages -- several years ago , before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach . roads are shut now to some of those villages , so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there , '' darvas said monday . he said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries , lacerations and dislocations . looking for missing loved ones in nepal ? cnn ireport wants to help . unicef , the u.n. children 's agency , said sunday that nearly 1 million nepalese children urgently need assistance . aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to nepal , with more on the way . high-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of mount everest , where the earthquake released deadly avalanches . four u.s. citizens are among those who died on everest , according to officials and relatives . damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain , not to mention the overall situation in nepal , means the climbing season is over for the year , climber jim davidson told cnn from the everest base camp , where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain . china has canceled all climbs on its side of the mountain , the official news agency xinhua reported . are you in nepal or do you have loved ones affected ? please share with us if you are in a safe place . how to help the earthquake victims . fast facts on earthquakes . cnn 's ivan watson and tim hume reported from kathmandu ; cnn 's jethro mullen wrote and reported from hong kong , and laura smith-spark wrote from london . cnn 's elizabeth joseph , pamela boykoff , manesh shrestha , sumnima udas , kristie lu stout , anjali tsui , kunal sehgal and ingrid formanek also contributed to this report .@\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb3*ravi opi , kavre district , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- by the time you reach the outskirts of nepal 's capital , even the roads are showing signs of the sheer magnitude of this earthquake -- and the enormity of the task awaiting a country struggling to come to terms with devastation and tragedy . the main highway that heads east out of kathmandu shows massive cracks , the tarmac torn apart by the force of saturday 's huge tremor . one lane is bisected by gaping , half-meter -lrb- 1.5 feet -rrb- fissures . they 've been filled in with rubble and dirt , allowing passage for those desperate citizens to reach their families in outlying districts . it takes an age , though , picking our way along damaged roads to a small village community , ravi opi . it is only 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- east of kathmandu but the journey takes almost two hours -- and the travel times likely to be compounded the farther out from the city people go . the community is off the main highway , down a dirt track that quickly finds itself winding through forested slopes and terraced fields . they farm corn here , and millet , and vegetables . compared to the capital , and the regions west of kathmandu and closer to the epicenter , the people here were relatively lucky . still , passing through villages it 's clear that damage has been suffered . in ravi opi a village official walks quickly by , telling us over his shoulder that 90 % of the houses are currently uninhabitable . some are still standing , but seem precarious and the residents are too scared of aftershocks to move back inside . patchy reports have filtered through of entire villages leveled by the quake or engulfed by landslides . maili tamang , 62 , is alive , but surveys the desolation the quake has wreaked on her life . we find her sitting as close as she can to the ruins of the house that she built with her late husband . she 's petite and frail but hardened by life . her leg , bandaged and suppurating , is stretched out in front of her . she periodically flicks at the flies that have settled on the blood - and pus-soaked dressing . `` i just want to cry , all i feel is hurt '' she says , showing us where she was the moment the earthquake struck . tamang 's house was one of the bigger ones in this region , a rare two-story structure . she and her husband built it together , a lifetime ago . he died years ago , but her extended family lived here with her until saturday . she , along with her daughter-in-law were indoors when the quake struck , and she was lucky to make it out onto a small wooden balcony . another tremor brought this down and she had to extricate herself from the rubble and crawl up an embankment . the younger woman , trapped in the wreckage after the roof fell in on her , eventually clawed her way out . she was transported by motorbike -- few here have motorized transportation ; most walk -- to a missionary hospital in a neighboring village , 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.4 miles -rrb- away from here . now she is back , wondering what the next step for her is . throughout this region , there have been small landslides and people have been industrious in clearing rubble from the roads . there is little sign of aid having made it out here . out of necessity people are back working their fields . near the road a family makes lunch in the open as their house was destroyed . elsewhere in ravi opi , other unfortunate families count the cost of the disaster . mahesh koiraba , 31 , lost his only daughter , prati in the quake , who was killed as their house collapsed . she was 2 years old . he was working when the quake hit , tilling the fields like so many in kavre , and ran back to his house after quickly realizing the force of the tremor . `` i started digging with my hands , '' he says , still very much in shock , but remembering his frantic efforts among the remains of his damaged home . `` and i saw her , blood was trickling from her mouth and she was covered in cuts . '' all he has left now is a picture in his phone ; a chubby-faced toddler , wearing oversized sunglasses . as rain starts falling -- soon turning into torrents and further hampering recovery efforts -- we huddle with four families who have been displaced . they 're in a makeshift , ramshackle shelter , crowded with frightened people . i ask one of the young women , osminda koirale , with me if she has seen any sign of outside help . `` no , no government has any support for us . no one has come out to see that we 're living like this . '' she said it was terrifying , and the future no less so . `` our house is gone now . we do n't know where we sit , what we eat . we do n't have any clothes , all our clothes are inside . we ca n't go inside our houses . '' there was a creeping sense that the worst was over , until another powerful aftershock overnight . `` we are not safe ... we are so scared , '' osminda tells me . and all this a mere 90 minutes drive from the capital . there are parts of nepal so remote it takes days to reach under normal circumstances -- there are villages here that one can only reach on foot and it is those areas that were hardest hit . these are the places where aid has yet to arrive , and where no one really knows the full extent of human loss or how many tragedies like the one at this home have unfolded . arwa damon reported from kavre district in nepal and euan mckirdy wrote from hong kong .h\\x0b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' he grows increasingly agitated , even as the line of questioning remains on-topic ; his attitude , meanwhile , grew increasingly smug . his eyes glaze over as the reporter talks , he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he 's much smarter than guru-murthy , and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say , `` do i really have to sit here with this guy ? '' at one point , he makes fun of guru-murthy for seeming nervous , saying , `` your foot is starting to jump a little bit . you better get to your next question . '' but it 's after guru-murthy asks downey whether he thinks he is `` free from all of that , '' referring to downey 's history of `` taking drugs , drinking '' that the building tension comes to a head . `` i 'm sorry , '' says downey , `` what are we doing ? '' to which guru-murthy replies , `` i 'm just asking questions , '' which indeed was so . downey has the right to refuse to answer the question , of course , but that 's not what he does next . instead , he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum : he smiles arrogantly , says `` bye ! '' and stands up to leave . he sure showed him ! it 's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they 're dating , what they 're eating , where they vacation , what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago . journalists often go too far , even if it 's their job . and certainly not every journalist is good at his job . but while downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past , questions that have been asked before , his business is our business . the entertainment industry is about entertaining people . as such , we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched . this is why most celebrities , especially those with a big budget movie to promote , agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general . but when the recognition no longer serves them ? then they want to bemoan it ? what downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions . that 's what an interview is . he certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate , or even ones he simply does n't feel like answering . but he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude , demeaning , and disrespectful -- even if he 's a celebrity , and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off . what the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak . after he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves , the actor can not resist a parting shot . he turns to the reporter , being sure to look directly at the camera on the way , and says , `` you seem okay . it 's just getting a little diane sawyer in here , '' followed by what sounds like , `` and you 're kind of a schmuck . '' downey might not have been `` in the mood '' to be questioned ... and those days , those moods , are understandable . we all have them . and yet in this case , that 's , well , too bad . the actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job . he has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being . given the terms , he is not entitled to call all the shots . that he thinks he can is perhaps our own , celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous ; is it any surprise when they reveal that they , too , regard themselves as better than everyone else ? but it 's still on him .\\xfc\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xea&washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- a new entry and a waiting game on the democratic side , a go-slow approach from a leading republican , and the big stakes of 2016 filled our sunday morning trip around the `` inside politics '' table . 1 . here 's ... bernie ! hillary clinton is about to get her first official challenger . sen. bernie sanders of vermont could make an announcement within days , reports cnn 's nia-malika henderson , adding a populist voice to a democratic race that starts with clinton as the overwhelming favorite . sanders has been exploring a run for months , and was a hit this weekend at a big south carolina democratic event . `` i do n't think he can necessarily challenge hillary clinton in terms of donors and in terms of organization , '' said henderson . `` but in terms of bringing the heat , bringing the fire , bringing that populist rhetoric , he 'll be interesting to see , and how he moves hillary clinton 's own rhetoric as well . '' 2 . for biden , watch , wait and ... few think vice president joe biden is willing to risk a third losing bid for the democratic presidential nomination . but his official word is that he is still looking at the race , and julie hirschfeld davis of the new york times reports that this `` wait and see '' approach is likely to continue for a bit . `` there is a strain of thinking that if hillary clinton 's campaign is truly to implode at some point , that democrats are going to need someone who can jump in quickly , raise a lot of money and have a lot of experience and launch a campaign , '' said davis . `` and joe biden would not mind being the person they talk about as that person . so , and as long as we are talking about that , we are still talking about joe biden , and that 's just the way he likes it . '' 3 . kasich also thinks waiting is best . ohio gov. john kasich is more visible of late , and makes no secret of the fact that he thinks he is the most qualified among the potential republican 2016 presidential prospects . but he is n't in a rush to make a formal declaration of candidacy . some see this as hesitation . but robert costa of the washington post detailed a conversation with the ohio governor in which kasich made the case that he need not rush . `` he 's not formally moving toward it right now , '' said costa . `` but i do n't think he feels a rush , because in this age of super pacs , it 's more about building donor relationships , building relationships in the early states , then maybe getting in when you have a little momentum . '' 4 . listen to the candidates -- and be reminded of the high stakes . personalities often trump policy in political coverage , especially in the early days of a campaign . but the old line `` elections have consequences '' gets repeated a lot because it just happens to be true . npr 's steve inskeep says the prospect of big changes was obvious as he did some recent homework about the 2016 race . `` jeb bush was asked this past week about president obama'a executive actions on immigration , and he said on a conservative radio talk show , ` yes , of course i would reverse them , ' '' said inskeep . `` so suddenly you are talking about millions of people who are on a path to be legalized for a while , now potentially on a path not to be legalized , depending on who wins an election . '' `` does n't mean they would go through with it . i think we all can recall president obama 's promise to close guantanamo right away if he could just replace president bush . but it certainly would color the campaign and the tenor of the campaign -- the huge changes that could lie in store depending on who wins . '' 5 . remember sharron angle ? the gop establishment sure does ! goal no. 1 for republicans in 2016 is taking back the white house . but preserving their new senate majority runs a close second -- and that will be no easy task , because so many of the competitive races are in states that tend to lean blue in presidential years . so the gop establishment is putting a priority on candidate recruitment and hoping to build on its 2014 successes , which you might recall included an aggressive effort to discourage or defeat tea party candidates viewed as too risky by the establishment . so in nevada , where democrat harry reid is retiring , there is an intensifying effort to get republican rep. joe heck to declare his senate candidacy . and in colorado , the establishment favorite is rep. mike coffman , who opened a lot of eyes with his 2014 race in a competitive swing district against a top-tier democratic opponent . those two states -- and those two seats -- have special significance in the 2016 maneuvering : reid and colorado democrat michael bennet won narrow 2010 victories in what was for the most part a big gop year . ask the establishment why , and you will get a ton of finger-pointing at the tea party candidates who emerged as the gop nominees -- sharron angle in nevada and ken buck in colorado .[\\x05\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfb4-lrb- cnn -rrb- thousands remain missing in nepal after a devastating earthquake struck the region on saturday . a majority of them are nepalese , indian and chinese residents , but a handful are adventurers , trekkers and vacationers who have not been heard from since the catastrophe . technology has played a huge role in helping families share their worries , ask for help and search for their missing loved ones . several organizations , such as google and the red cross , have published features about the missing on their websites . and on cnn ireport , dozens of people have filed reports pleading for information that might help them locate their missing friends and relatives . the death toll in nepal is rising ; it has now surpassed more than 5,000 . though the news is mostly heartbreaking and worrisome , there have been stories of survival , of families reconnecting with loved ones days after the disaster . the walk of survival . after hearing about devastation in nepal , ahmed shadmann of bangladesh reached out to his nation 's embassy in nepal , made calls to old college contacts in south asia and posted pleas on social media to help find his younger sister raisaa tashnova . tashnova , 25 , was with a group of friends at the last resort , a spa-like resort near the border with china . when the earthquake struck , she was getting ready for a group excursion , a canyon swing . she could see the ground splitting apart beneath her feet . what scared her most was seeing large boulders crashing down from the mountains above . she prayed she would n't be crushed . she ran from the toppling boulders and shielded herself . when the tremors subsided , tashnova and her friends huddled together and camped on higher ground overnight , expecting to be rescued . when three days passed and no one came to their aid , the group decided to take their chances and leave the confines of the resort . the walk toward kathmandu was treacherous . the roads near the resort were mostly blocked or in bad shape because of a landslide . but the worst part was the smell of rotting flesh , which permeated the air as she passed countless villages flattened by the quake . `` it was a walk of survival , '' she said . `` my brain refused to feel anything apart from putting one leg before the other until the mountains were left behind . '' tashnova hiked six hours through mountainous terrain toward nepal 's capital . after navigating down tricky mountain slopes , she and her friends came across a village and hitched a ride on a local bus . she was able to connect with her family , nearly four days after the quake , from the airport in kathmandu while waiting for the next flight to bangladesh . she was exhausted . she had n't showered or slept since before the quake . when shadmann got the call from his sister , he said it felt fantastic . `` what was surprising is that her voice sounded very strong . it did n't seem like she had gone through a terrible episode in her life , '' he said . there was little information . dr. carol pineda and her husband , michael macdonald , of massachusetts , were vacationing in nepal when the quake struck . her brother , james pineda , got news of the disaster from a friend . it was n't until he heard the high casualty figures and reports about the avalanches that he started to get scared . he was prepared for the worst , knowing they were traveling to a himalayan base camp in nepal . but that was basically all he knew . james combed through what little information his sister left for him before the trip , but it did n't include the name of the tour group or the hotel where they were staying . he took to social media and started emailing and calling hiking groups that operated in nepal , but no one was getting back to him . on sunday , he managed to get inside his sister 's apartment in boston and find documents with information on the trekking company the pair were using . it was n't until that evening , after emailing the company , that he got a short reply saying that his sister and her husband were safe . but that was all the information he had , and he wanted to hear directly from his sister , so he took to twitter to see what other people were doing to track down loved ones . several strangers who were in the same location as the couple responded to his inquiries on social media , saying they were fine . `` it was incredible to see people that were stranded themselves over there wanting to help me . at least now we knew they were safe , '' he said . on monday , the couple left a voicemail for macdonald 's parents saying they were making their way to the kathmandu in hopes of catching a flight out . only one phone call left . janaki parajuli , a nepalese tour guide , was busy saturday morning , leading a tour group of 17 senior citizens -- nine americans , five canadians and three nepalese -- from kathmandu to tibet . they had stopped for lunch at liping village , just near the border , when the magnitude 7.8 quake struck . once the tremors eased , parajuli noticed that his cell phone had died . his connection with the outside world had vanished . worse , he had a group of older travelers and a short supply of food and water . one american in the group had an international cell phone , but its battery was quickly dying . unable to contact anyone in the area , parajuli made one last attempt , calling his daughter . thousands of miles away , in louisiana , jyotsna parajuli picked up that call . her father explained the situation : the roads were blocked and there was no way to get back to kathmandu or enter into tibet . the only way to escape was by helicopter . jyotsna learned from the u.s. embassy that a family had hired a private rescue team , working with the nepalese army , to rescue the stranded tourists by helicopter , but the team was unable to land because of bad weather . other rescue and relief operations in the region have faced similar weather issues . crews planning to help those desperately in need are having to wait for storms to subside . parajuli was told later that 23 people were rescued from the area and left on a bus headed for kathmandu , but she was n't sure if her father or his tour group were among them . `` all the people in the group are 60 years old or older . my dad said two americans in the group were sick because of the weather and altitude , and since the people were older , they could n't walk to help , '' she said . now she is anxiously waiting for the weather to clear , and hoping to hear her father 's voice again . if you are looking for someone , we invite you to share your story on cnn ireport . see scenes from nepal after the earthquake . cnn 's sarah brown and anne claire stapleton contributed to this report .\\xbf\\x18\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf8.canberra , australia -lrb- cnn -rrb- before `` bali nine '' duo , andrew chan and myuran sukumaran , the last australian executed for drug offenses abroad was van tuong nguyen by singapore in 2005 . although canberra then , as it is now , was strongly opposed to the death penalty , van 's death did not harm australia 's relationship with singapore , nor the australian people 's view of that country . the executions of chan and sukumaran early wednesday morning will be a different story . their deaths will result in short to medium term frictions between canberra and jakarta at the highest levels . however , this will soon ease as the two countries have a number of common interests that neither side can abandon . but the australian public 's view of indonesia , and anger with its government , will take much longer to subside . those sympathetic to the dilemma faced by indonesia 's president joko widodo will argue that he was politically bound to allow the executions to take place . he ran on a robust anti-drug campaign , arguing that 18,000 indonesians die from illicit drugs each year , though those figures are widely disputed . as the saga over whether the executions would take place dragged on for months , following ever more desperate legal challenges from the defense teams , widodo painted himself into a corner . the widespread australian perception is that the president owed his power to pdi-p chairperson and former president megawati sukarnoputri . believed by many to be the most powerful person in the country , some suggest that megawati insisted widodo stand by his hard-line anti-drugs policy and stare down australian pressure -- or lose her support and reputation as a firm leader in the process . as recently as last year , it seemed that australian prime minister tony abbott empathized with the underlying pressures and back-room obligations on leaders . while working assiduously behind the scenes to argue for clemency for the `` bali nine '' duo , abbott nevertheless appeared to accept the inevitability of the executions , even as he publicly reiterated australia 's opposition to capital punishment . such a softly -- softly approach was also aided by an australian public that did not seem overly interested in the plight of chan and sukumaran . all that changed when credible stories began to emerge about the rehabilitation of the two australian prisoners : chan becoming a pastor and respected religious example for his fellow prisoners and sukumaran a passionate painter with impressive talent . such was the regard held for the australian duo that even the governor of the kerobokan jail where they were kept , sudjonggo , urged a reconsideration of their impending executions . as the duo attracted greater public sympathy -- including from a joint statement by the last six prime ministers urging jakarta to reconsider -- the good , great and popular in australian society also united behind the plea for mercy . under increasing pressure in the polls , the abbott government began to publicly pursue what it had been doing in private : urging a stay of execution on legal and moral grounds -- even once reminding jakarta of the over $ 1 billion worth of aid that indonesia has received from australia over the past decade . australians have a dim view of how indonesia has responded . while jakarta and many indonesian people viewed this as typical posturing and moral grandstanding from a developed western neighbor , australians began to once again see indonesia in an unattractive light -- when it was so recently upheld as the shining example of a rising democracy in southeast asia . the hard-line stance of widodo was seen as the heartless and self-interested actions of a weak and inexperienced president attempting to establish his authority -- at the expense of rehabilitated australian lives . credible accusations by the defense attorney for the two australians that a lighter sentence was denied to them because of their incapacity to pay the bribe demanded of them from the sentencing judges affirmed perceptions of indonesia 's judicial system as corrupt if not incompetent . particularly galling for the abbott government and australians was widodo 's refusal to even accept a phone call from abbott to discuss the issue , and the wall of silence and non-engagement that confronted australian ministers attempting to plead the case with indonesian counterparts . perhaps the final straw was indonesia 's decision to deploy hundreds of commandos and four naval ships to transport the handcuffed prisoners from bali to their island for execution -- viewed in australia as a deliberate backhander by jakarta to canberra . the abbott government had warned of unspecified consequences should the executions take place , and on wednesday morning announced the unprecedented recall of australia 's ambassador to indonesia . there are unlikely to be any ministerial visits between the two countries for many months , if not the rest of the year . while australia is not likely to withdraw aid to indonesia , canberra will also ensure that it offers jakarta no special favors in the immediate future . given the degree of ongoing cooperation on important issues , such as terrorism , money laundering and drug trafficking , australia and indonesia will continue to work together behind the scenes at the operational levels . australia will also need ongoing indonesia cooperation to stem the flow of illegal boat arrivals to australian shores and will not want to jeopardize what has already been achieved . for these reasons , the fallout between capitals will be contained . but while the indonesian public appears divided as to whether their government acted wisely , the australian public is united that jakarta did not . this means that for them , and even as a democracy , the older images of indonesia as a corrupt , immature and unpredictable neighbor will return . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author .\\x02\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc0)western australia -lrb- cnn -rrb- many australians are understandably appalled by the brutal and pointless executions of andrew chan and myuran sukumaran . the death penalty looks anachronistic and ineffective at the best of times , but to kill two people who had clearly made the most of their long periods of incarceration to transform themselves and make amends for their actions looks gratuitous and cruel . consequently , indonesia 's actions raise more general questions about the powers we give to states -- or , more accurately , to those who control the coercive apparatus of the state at any particular moment . as german sociologist max weber pointed out , one of the key features of an effective state is that it has a monopoly over the legitimate use of violence . state officials can order people to be killed because -- especially in democracies -- we authorize them to do so . we can give no more significant power to another human being than to decide who lives or who dies . and yet even where that authority is deemed legitimate -- as is clearly the case in indonesia -- its significance is only seriously considered at moments like this , when the very personal circumstances of some of its victims become the stuff of popular commentary and media interest . less prominent victims of state-sanctioned violence often go entirely unremarked . however disappointed we may be in the actions of indonesian president joko widodo -- in whom so many inside and outside indonesia have invested such hopes as a progressive force -- he can make a couple of claims in his defense . first , widodo -- popularly known as jokowi -- is indonesia 's elected leader and is fulfilling his promise to crack down on what he and many other indonesians see as a problem . indonesia 's domestic political context and the need to be seen as not giving favorable treatment to foreigners left him very little room to maneuver . this is not a justification for his actions , but it helps to explain why he was so impervious to pleas for mercy . whatever we may think about the underlying principles and administration of justice in indonesia , at least jokowi can claim that it is essentially a domestic issue . we may not like indonesia 's laws , but they are being applied even-handedly within national borders where state officials have authority . significantly , it is those same national borders that demarcate the extent of indonesia 's leaders ability -- or even desire , perhaps -- to use their capacity for state-sanctioned violence . other countries -- including australia -- have no such inhibitions and regularly kill perfectly innocent civilians in the course of one conflict or another . this propensity for the application of state-sanctioned violence seems especially germane when we consider another president about whom great things were expected , but who has inevitably disappointed . after the unilateralism of george w. bush , barack obama was widely predicted to be a very different sort of president and one who would not make the sort of catastrophic strategic miscalculations of his predecessor . paradoxically enough , though , while obama has been widely criticized for a lack of decisiveness and unwillingness to commit more american forces to the middle east , this has done nothing to curb the use of state-sanctioned violence . on the contrary , the use of drone strikes has become a key part of america 's continuing war on terror . it is unsurprising , perhaps , that a cerebral and reflective leader as obama is should be attracted to drones as a weapon of choice . unlike jokowi , obama does n't have to confront the personal narratives of the people who die at his command . or he does n't unless they 're american citizens , at least . the recent death of an american hostage during a recent drone strike highlights the potential for `` collateral damage '' . are these cases comparable ? yes and no . widodo 's executions were cold-blooded , unnecessary and highly political . obama clearly was not intending to kill americans , and this has only become an issue because one of the hostages actually was . however , dozens of entirely innocent women and children from other countries are routinely killed in such strikes with little comment . the key point is that we are collectively responsible for such deaths at some level or another , especially if our leaders and state officials carry them out . do good intentions justify one death and not another ? perhaps . would we encourage the state to kill a thousand innocents if it meant eliminating hitler ? almost certainly . would we authorize a drone strike to kill isis leader abu bakr al-baghdad if we thought a couple of passers-by might die , too ? perhaps . would we permit the state to execute people ? not any longer in australia , at least . but before we congratulate ourselves on how civilized and humane we 've become , perhaps we should pause to consider the violence that is still being inflicted on perfectly innocent people around the world in our collective name . what was done in the name of the indonesian state was undoubtedly awful , futile and reprehensible . whether our moral calculus is quite so self-evidently superior is not quite so clear . copyright 2015 the conversation . some rights reserved .\\xc3&\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd8J-lrb- cnn -rrb- it came a day early . baltimore investigators handed their files on freddie gray 's death over to prosecutors thursday , but the public should n't expect much . it 's largely a procedural step , and given the overtures from baltimore officials , the state 's attorney 's decision on whether to file charges against the six officers involved in the arrest will not be immediate . no reports will be made public , police commissioner anthony batts said , echoing an assertion he made last week that even after the prosecutors receive the files , the task force assigned to gray 's death will continue investigating . `` that is just us sitting down , providing all the data we have . we will continue to follow the evidence wherever it goes , '' batts said . the gray family 's legal team had no expectations otherwise . `` i hate to say this , but i think if people are waiting for answers or charges to come , '' attorney mary koch said this week , `` i do n't think that 's going to happen based on the way the process works , and i think that the government officials need to advise people of how the process honestly works and to lower their expectations about what 's going to happen . '' mayor stephanie rawlings-blake seemed reluctant to do so during a thursday interview with cnn . pressed several times on whether answers would be forthcoming , the mayor seemed to dance around the question . handing over the report represents `` an inflection point , '' she said at first , before explaining that it also marks a `` continuation in a process toward justice . '' she went on to reiterate a point officials have made several times , that releasing information hastily could jeopardize the probe and any possible prosecution . asked again if it was fair for people to assume they would not get answers immediately , she said baltimore officials had a `` duty to protect the justice process . '' prodded on whether the public should expect her or batts to announce findings , she said she did n't want to `` seek justice for optics '' and explained she had spoken to schools , clergy and community leaders about what to expect . finally , asked flat out if people should expect an end to the saga when the report was handed over , she replied : `` well , it ca n't be the end . there 's been no charges . there 's been no trial . it can not be the end . '' the family understands the process and was warned at the outset to be patient , koch said thursday . `` we 've told the family from the beginning that answers were not going to come quickly and that the investigation needed to be full and complete , ... and hopefully what will happen is the correct people are charged , those charged are prosecuted and that prosecution sticks , '' she said . perhaps lost amid the chaos that has descended on baltimore is that there is not one , but two investigations , seeking to determine how gray suffered a fatal spine injury in police custody . the mayhem since gray 's april 19 death a week after his arrest -- the looting , vandalism , blazes , attacks on police and firefighters , marauding criminals stoking the havoc -- has overtaken , or at least outweighed , updates about the investigations . newly appointed attorney general loretta lynch said monday that the justice department 's civil rights division and the fbi `` will continue our careful and deliberate examination of the facts in the coming days and weeks . '' because of the baltimore police 's history , the justice department has been working with the force since october as part of a reform initiative that will assess `` policies , training and operations as they relate to use of force and interactions with citizens . '' rawlings-blake requested that the justice department take a look at the police department , the baltimore sun reported , saying her request came on the heels of the newspaper 's report that the city had paid almost $ 6 million in judgments and settlements in 102 police misconduct civil suits since 2011 . overwhelmingly , the sun reported , the people involved in the incidents that sparked the lawsuits were cleared of criminal charges . asked during her thursday interview why no police officers have yet been charged in gray 's case -- given that if the case involved civilians instead of officers there would ostensibly be probable cause for arrests -- rawlings-blake , an attorney by trade , said the question amounted to speculation and cited her efforts to reform the baltimore police department and repair the community 's mistrust in police . `` quite likely , but it could be the same situation , and at the end of the day , it 's about this case and making sure we 're getting this case right . it has nothing to do with speculation about any other cases out there . this family wants justice . they do n't want us to sit here and speculate about what could 've have happened if it was a private citizen that did it , '' she said . rawlings-blake and police officials have repeatedly promised answers and accountability . `` we welcome outside review , '' police spokesman capt. eric kowalczyk has said . `` we want to be open . we want to be transparent . we owe it to the city , and we owe it to the gray family to find out exactly what happened . '' according to police , officers encountered gray on april 12 and he `` fled unprovoked . '' three officers gave chase , apprehended gray and carried him -- screaming , his legs dangling listlessly -- to a police transport van . once at the police station , officers requested an ambulance , which took gray to the university of maryland 's shock trauma center , where he died a week later . an autopsy report indicated gray died of a spinal injury , but batts has said that the medical examiner was still awaiting a toxicology report and a spinal expert 's analysis before issuing his final report . so far , six officers involved in the arrest have been suspended with pay : sgt. alicia white , 30 ; officer william porter , 25 ; officer garrett miller , 26 ; officer edward nero , 29 ; lt. brian rice , 41 ; and officer caesar goodson , 45 . five of them have given statements to investigators , batts said . releasing the officers ' names is standard procedure after an in-custody death and in no way implicates wrongdoing , kowalczyk said . though the investigation is not yet complete , batts said last week there are at least two indications that officers involved in gray 's arrest did not follow protocol . `` we know he was not buckled in the transport wagon , as he should 've been . no excuses for that , period , '' he said . `` we know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times . '' that gray was n't buckled has raised speculation that he was injured during what 's known as a `` rough ride '' or `` nickel ride , '' in which officers place a handcuffed suspect in a police van and drive recklessly so as to toss the suspect around . asked if gray could have incurred his injuries via a rough ride or outside of the van , batts said there is `` potential '' that both could be true . baltimore police have established a task force of 30 investigators -- including members of the force investigation unit and homicide detectives -- to look into gray 's death , batts said . they 've conducted dozens of interviews , canvassed the region on foot seeking witnesses and procured video from closed-circuit television cameras . deputy commissioner kevin davis , who is overseeing the task force as the head of the investigations and intelligence bureau , said last week that the evidence suggested the transport van carrying gray made three stops before delivering him to the police station . but on thursday , he said a privately owned camera had captured evidence of a fourth stop . rice and two other officers on bikes were the first to see gray , davis said last week . two officers remained on their bikes and one gave chase on foot , pursuing gray for about one-fifth of a mile , he said . `` that 's where the apprehension of freddie gray occurred , and quite frankly , that 's exactly where freddie gray should have received medical attention , and he did not , '' davis said last week . the paddy wagon carrying gray traveled about one block before stopping , and gray was removed from the van and placed in leg irons , davis said last week . on thursday , davis revealed that the van stopped again , about a mile from where police placed shackles on gray . he did not elaborate on that stop . from there , according to the narrative davis provided last week , the van then traveled about half a mile before stopping again `` to deal with mr. gray , and the facts of that interaction are under investigation , '' he said . it was at that stop , batts added , that officers lifted gray off the floor and placed him on a seat in the transport van . gray requested a medic during that stop , he said . the van then traveled to another incident , about a mile away and just a few hundred feet from where gray was first spotted and chased . there , a second prisoner was placed in the van , which headed back to the police department 's western district building , about a mile away , the deputy commissioner said . it was only then that an ambulance was called and gray was taken to the hospital . `` it 's complex , '' davis said of the probe . `` it involves a minutiae of details . it requires our full talents , our full time , and we 're going to get this right .

      "b\"\\xc6--lrb- cnn -rrb- german police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple , a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near frankfurt , a german terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told cnn on thursday . german prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the frankfurt-area town of oberursel on suspicion of planning a boston-style attack , but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target . the suspected target , according to florian flade , the terrorism researcher , was a race planned for friday . the race loops around eshborn and frankfurt on may day each year , attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route . prosecutor albrecht schreiber said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used , 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition , a gun , the essential parts of a g-3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide , which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the west , including the 2005 london bombings . earlier thursday , andreas hemmes , a spokesman for the police of west hesse , told cnn that the house and car of two individuals in oberursel , in the forested hills west of frankfurt , had been searched . as a result of what had been found , police had expanded their search along the l3004 road on the bike race route , hemmes said . `` we suspect that there was a salafist background , '' said peter beuth , the interior minister for hesse , referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of islam . `` police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an islamist attack . '' flade , a journalist at die welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids , told cnn that a german couple of turkish descent -- halil and senay d. -- were under arrest . he said the couple had ties to radical islamist circles in the frankfurt area . neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group . last week german police observed halil d. moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living . they suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route , according to flade . flade said that according to german police documents , german police first became aware of the couple at the end of march when they went to a garden center near frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide . he said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons . the first was that the woman was covered in a full veil . the second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden , but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds . furthermore , after police thwarted a bomb plot by german extremists trained in the tribal areas of pakistan to kill american servicemen in germany in september 2007 with hydrogen peroxide-based bombs -- the so-called `` sauerland '' plot -- german law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide . according to flade , after the tipoff , german investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were . all they had to go on was the surveillance footage . the woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape , so they did not immediately know who they were . but in early to mid-april they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple 's radical ties . according to flade , german police established that the couple had recently traveled to spain , where they met with members of sharia4spain , a radical pro-jihadist group linked to al muhajiroun in the united kingdom . spanish police had monitored the meeting in spain . they also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with aqim , al qaeda 's north african affiliate . and they found the couple were in contact with a young radical islamist from frankfurt who had gone to fight in syria at the end of last year and was recently killed . the pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by boston marathon bombers tamerlan and dzhokhar tsarnaev . flade said the device recovered near frankfurt included nails as shrapnel . the boston bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in inspire magazine , an online engish language magazine put out by al qaeda in yemen , which has also been translated into german and other languages . in august 2013 , the british security agency mi5 revealed to parliament 's intelligence and security committee that inspire has been `` read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the uk since its first issue -lrb- in 2010 -rrb- . we judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots . '' like other european countries , germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to syria and iraq . in recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in germany 's large turkish diaspora community . travel to syria is particularly easy for individuals of turkish descent because turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to syria . according to flade , almost 700 germans are believed to have traveled to syria and iraq , with up to 90 % joining isis . one-third of these have returned to germany and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in syria and iraq . there has only been one fatal terrorist attack in germany since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two u.s. airmen outside frankfurt airport by a lone-wolf radicalized islamist in march 2011 . cnn 's fred pleitgen contributed to this report .s\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x998-lrb- cnn -rrb- shortly after being elected chief prosecutor , baltimore city state 's attorney marilyn mosby said prosecutors in the hardscrabble town had the `` toughest job in america . '' mosby , who took over her first elected post in january , now faces what is likely to be the toughest case of her nascent career -- deciding whether criminal charges should be filed against baltimore police officers in the controversial death of freddie gray . gray , 25 , died in police custody from a fatal spinal cord injury , one week after he was arrested . six officers involved in his arrest have been suspended with pay pending an investigation . mosby , 35 , who comes from a long line of police officers , including her grandfather , four uncles and her mother , assumes a key role in the latest case to draw national attention to the issue of relations between police officers and the communities they are sworn to serve . `` my grandfather was one of the first african-american police officers in massachusetts and one of the things he instilled on us is the importance of public service , '' mosby said in a campaign video . freddie gray 's mysterious death has turned the largely black city near the nation 's capital into a tinderbox where mostly peaceful demonstrations on monday erupted in pockets of looting and rioting in the hours after gray 's funeral . a 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect two days ago , and national guard troops have joined baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order . on thursday , as police handed their investigative files over to the state attorney 's officer a day earlier than planned , supporters of the former insurance company lawyer expressed confidence in mosby 's ability to handle the volatile case . `` we 're enthusiastic about the new prosecutor , '' said william `` billy '' murphy jr. , a former baltimore judge who is now the lead attorney for gray 's family . `` she comes to the office with a belief in the integrity of these kinds of investigations . we have much more confidence in her than we have in the police because there 's never been any level of confidence , nor should there be , in the police investigating themselves . '' mosby confirmed in a statement thursday that she had received the police 's investigative report . she said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings , her team has been conducting its own independent probe into the april 19 death . 45 cvs workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores . `` while we have and will continue to leverage the information received by the department , we are not relying solely on their findings , but rather the facts that we have gathered and verified , '' mosby said . `` we ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system . '' mosby is married to baltimore city councilman nick mosby , who represents areas of west baltimore where riots erupted earlier this week . the couple have two young daughters . `` she 's my wife , '' nick mosby told cnn on thursday . `` she 's a strong woman . she was built for this ... i was at church service the other day and they were talking about being at the right place with the right person at the right time . i know her heart has always been convicted to ensure that justice will be served fairly and equally across the board . '' during her campaign , mosby spoke about the broad daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep . `` i learned very early on that the criminal justice system is n't just the police , the judges and the state 's attorney , '' she said . `` it 's much more than that . i believe that we are the justice system . we , the members of the community , are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes . '' mosby said her cousin 's 1994 murder was her first introduction to the criminal justice system . `` having to go to court and deal with prosecutors , '' she said . `` having to go to court and see my neighbor who had the courage and audacity to cooperate with the police ... to testify in court and the way the district attorney 's office treated my family is something that inspired me . '' mosby , who grew up in boston , is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major city in the united states , according to the state 's attorney 's website . at the age of 6 , mosby was accepted in a school desegregation program in massachusetts . she later participated in a study of the civil rights movement . `` after having that awesome experience i knew i wanted to be an attorney , '' she said during her campaign . a. dwight pettit , a civil rights attorney and mosby supporter , said he believes she will `` deliver on doing it right , and getting it right . i 'm confident in that . '' `` she 's very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office , and so i believe that she will move in a methodical way , '' he said . `` and i think that she will follow where the evidence leads . i do not think she will follow just public opinion . '' when she was sworn in as chief prosecutor earlier this year , mosby brought up the lack of trust between the community and police . `` our time to repair that trust , to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now , '' she said . mosby added , `` as a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color , i will seek justice on your behalf . '' mosby is african-american , as are mayor stephanie rawlings-blake , police commissioner anthony batts and other leading baltimore officials . although about 63 % of baltimore 's population is black , they face stunning disparities when it comes to income , employment , poverty , housing , incarceration and overall health . the people on mosby 's transition team included former mayor kurt schmoke , former congressman and naacp president kweisi mfume and murphy , who is now representing gray 's family . schmoke , a former state 's attorney and baltimore 's first african-american mayor , said mosby 's background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice . `` i actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state 's attorney , marilyn mosby , was recently elected , '' he said . `` she has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience . i ca n't say how long , but i do think that people will give her a little bit more time to do it right rather than to do it fast . '' mosby defeated gregg bernstein as state 's attorney in a 2014 election . `` baltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court -- we 've got the toughest job in america , '' she said in a statement after the election . mary koch , another attorney for gray 's family , said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her . `` the family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that 's not going to be an easy job for ms. mosby , '' said koch , adding : `` that 's her job . that 's the job she took on .

      "b\"\\xaf,-lrb- cnn -rrb- kim bok-dong is 89 now , and is going blind and deaf . she knows her health is fading , and she can no longer walk unassisted . but her eyes burn bright with a passion borne of redressing her suffering of a lifetime ago . she enters a meeting of tokyo foreign correspondents in a wheelchair , visibly exhausted after a flight from seoul and days of interviews and meetings . the nightmares from five years as a sex slave of the japanese army , from 1940 onwards , are still crystal clear . kim is determined to share her story with anyone who will listen , until she 's no longer physically able . `` my only wish is to set the record straight about the past . before i die , '' kim says . kim was a 14-year-old girl when the japanese came to her village in korea . she says they told her she had no choice but to leave her home and family to support the war effort by working at a sewing factory . `` there was no option not to go , '' she recalls . `` if we did n't go , we 'd be considered traitors , '' instead of going to a sewing factory , kim says she ended up in japanese military brothels in half a dozen countries . along with about 30 other women , she says she was locked in a room and forced to do things no teenage girl -- no woman -- should ever have to do . kim describes seemingly endless days of soldiers lined up outside the brothel , called a `` comfort station . '' often they were so close to the front lines , they could hear the battles of world war two happening all around them . `` our job was to revitalize the soldiers , '' she says . `` on saturdays , they would start lining up at noon . and it would last until 8pm . there was always a long line of soldiers . on sunday it was 8 a.m to 5 p.m. again , a long line . i did n't have the chance to count how many . '' kim estimates each japanese soldier took around three minutes . they usually kept their boots and leg wraps on , hurriedly finishing so the next solider could have his turn . kim says it was dehumanizing , exhausting , and often excruciating . `` when it was over , i could n't even get up . it went on for such a long time . by the time the sun went down , i could n't use my lower body at all . after the first year , we were just like machines , '' she says . kim believes the years of physical abuse took a permanent toll on her body . tears stream down her cheeks as she explains how she was never able to fulfill her dream of having children . `` when i started , the japanese military would often beat me because i was n't submissive , '' kim says . `` there are no words to describe my suffering . even now . i ca n't live without medicine . i 'm always in pain . '' kim is part of an ngo called the `` korean council for the women drafted for military sexual slavery by japan , '' which is fighting for an apology . some japanese prime ministers have personally apologized in the past , but the ngo director believes that it 's not nearly enough . tokyo maintains its legal liability for the wrongdoing was cleared by a bilateral claims treaty signed in 1965 between south korea and japan . kim 's story matches testimony from other so-called `` comfort women . '' in washington , as japanese prime minister shinzo abe conducts a state visit to the united states , former korean sex slave lee yong-soo makes a tearful plea to him , demanding an official apology for japan 's sexual enslavement of an estimated 200,000 comfort women , mostly korean and chinese . many have since passed away , but those still alive want individual compensation for their treatment . critics say abe has not been vocal enough . they fear his government is trying to whitewash the past , to appease conservatives who feel comfort women were paid prostitutes , not victims of official military policy . `` when it comes to the comfort women sex slave system , it is pretty much unique to japan . i think nazi germany had some of it to a smaller degree . but in the japanese case it was large scale , and state-sponsored , essentially , '' says koichi nakano , a professor of political science at tokyo 's sophia university . nakano points out that , since abe first came to office his government has succeeded in removing references to `` comfort women '' from many japanese school textbooks . it 's part of what critics call japan 's track record of glossing over its war crimes . '' -lrb- comfort women -rrb- have gone through tremendous trauma . and in a way , the japanese government risks a second rape by discrediting their testimonies and treating -lrb- their experiences -rrb- as if they were lies , '' nakano says . abe insists he and other prime ministers have made repeated apologies . `` i am deeply pained to think of the comfort women who experienced immeasurable pain and suffering , '' abe told diet lawmakers last year . abe gave a similarly worded statement during a press conference tuesday in washington , dc -- leading critics to question the sincerity of abe 's expressions of remorse over the issue . abe has said he does not believe women were coerced to work in the military brothels . nakano says abe and conservative lawmakers feel `` singled out . '' `` they feel there 's some sort of a plot by other asian countries to sully the japanese name to their advantage . '' with abe 's historic visit to the u.s. just months before the 70th anniversary of the end of world war two , kim wants president obama to pressure his key asian ally to do more to acknowledge history . meanwhile , kim has had enough of the excuses she says are hampering her efforts to finally get peace . `` to say there 's no evidence is absurd . i am the evidence , '' she says .\\x11\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa5\\x1c-lrb- cnn -rrb- about a dozen native american actors have walked off the set of an adam sandler movie comedy , saying the satirical western 's script is insulting to native americans and women , according to a report . the walkout occurred wednesday on the set of `` the ridiculous six '' near las vegas , new mexico , according to the indian country today media network . the script called for native women 's names such as `` beaver 's breath '' and `` no bra '' and an actress portraying an apache woman to squat and urinate while smoking a peace pipe , ictmn reported . `` when i began doing this film , i had an uneasy feeling inside of me and i felt so conflicted . ... we talked to the producers about our concerns . they just told us , ` if you guys are so sensitive , you should leave , ' '' said allison young , a navajo and one of the actors who left the set . `` nothing has changed , '' she told ictmn . `` we are still just hollywood indians . '' `` they were being disrespectful , '' added david hill , a choctaw actor . `` they were bringing up those same old arguments that dan snyder uses in defending the -lrb- washington -rrb- redskins . but let me tell you , our dignity is not for sale . '' produced by sandler 's happy madison productions as part of a four-picture deal with netflix , `` the ridiculous six '' also stars will forte , taylor lautner , steve buscemi , john turturro , nick nolte , luke wilson and rob schneider , among others . the ictmn describes the movie as a western spoof on `` the magnificent seven , '' the 1960 classic about gunfighters who protect a village from a group of bandits . the movie was co-written by sandler and is being directed by his frequent collaborator frank coraci . actors playing historical figures include david spade as general custer , blake shelton as wyatt earp and vanilla ice as mark twain , according to the internet movie database . sandler had not commented publicly on the walkout as of friday morning , although people were criticizing him in comments posted on his facebook page . `` hey adam , act like an adult for once . respect others , especially native americans , '' wrote one commenter . in a statement sent to cnn and other media outlets , netflix defended the movie as satire : . `` the movie has ridiculous in the title for a reason : because it is ridiculous . it is a broad satire of western movies and the stereotypes they popularized , featuring a diverse cast that is not only part of -- but in on -- the joke . '' the native american actors who spoke to ictmn were n't laughing , however . one , loren anthony , posted a photo to instagram from the set monday along with a comment saying , `` having a good time , great cast , great crew and feeling blessed to be here . '' but by wednesday , the navajo actor had become disillusioned and joined others in walking out . he told ictmn he felt insulted because costumes he and others wore to portray apache indians were not authentic . `` we were supposed to be apache , but it was really stereotypical and we did not look apache at all . we looked more like comanche , '' he said . according to ictmn , a native american adviser hired to help ensure the movie 's cultural authenticity also walked off the set in protest . hill , the choctaw actor , seemed to hold out hope that differences between the producers and native american cast members could be resolved . `` i hope they will listen to us , '' he told ictmn . `` we understand this is a comedy , we understand this is humor , but we wo n't tolerate disrespect .

      "b\"\\x99/-lrb- cnn -rrb- japanese prime minister shinzo abe is scheduled to speak wednesday to a joint meeting of congress . the address marks the first time in history that the head of the japanese government will address the entire u.s. congress , and given the importance of the u.s.-japan relationship , it is an invitation long overdue . so far , prime minister abe 's appearance has garnered much less attention than last month 's speech to congress by israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu . this is not surprising ; in a recent survey by the pew research center nearly three-quarters of the respondents indicated they had `` never heard of '' shinzo abe , underscoring just how difficult it is for the obama administration to sell its much-vaunted `` pivot '' or `` rebalance '' to the american public . nevertheless , abe arrives in washington at an opportune time to help along the economic centerpiece of the `` pivot , '' the trans-pacific partnership free trade agreement , or tpp . the tpp is a potentially massive free trade agreement involving the united states , japan and 10 other pacific-facing nations -- combined , these countries account for 40 % of global gdp . and beyond its potential economic impact , it also allows the united states to expand its influence in asia , providing an alternative to china-centered agreements such as the regional cooperative economic partnership . the stakes , therefore , are significant . but so is some of the opposition to an agreement that has been negotiated in secret . prominent democrats such as ohio sen. sherrod brown and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , for example , have been critical of the tpp , arguing that provisions such as one on international arbitration of disputes between investors and states undermine u.s. sovereignty . but the immediate battle in congress is not over the tpp directly , but something called trade promotion authority , or `` fast-track . '' trade promotion authority , which would allow trade agreements such as the tpp to come before congress without amendment , has been on the books for decades . the power to use trade promotion authority , however , must be periodically reauthorized . congress voted narrowly to give president bush trade promotion authority in 2002 , but that authority expired in 2007 and has not been renewed . there is near universal agreement that the current talks can not be concluded unless the congress reauthorizes trade promotion authority , without which the 11 other nations that are parties to the talks can not be confident that the united states speaks with one voice . republicans control both houses of congress , and are generally supportive of free trade . but while passage of trade promotion authority in the senate is likely , the result in the house , where abe will be speaking , is less certain . this is in part because some house republicans are simply loath to delegate any power to the president , while others are certainly aware of the ramifications of the trade promotion authority vote for 2016 . after all , the fact that republicans would actually be supporting the proposal of a democratic president will not prevent democrats -- and their labor supporters -- from using the vote as a weapon to diminish support for republicans among those white , working-class voters who were so crucial to republican success in the 2014 midterm . but even if trade promotion authority passes , the fight over the tpp is far from over . provisions in the trade promotion authority bills just voted out of the committees will require review for at least four months after the negotiations are concluded and before congress can grant final approval to the tpp . this likely throws the tpp vote directly into the path of the 2016 presidential race . ironically , the fact that democrats seem likely to nominate hillary clinton , an early supporter of the tpp , may go a long way to blunting this attack . still , it is hard to see house republicans willing to `` go it alone '' on the tpp without some democratic buy-in . which brings us back to prime minister abe 's speech . given that we are fast approaching the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii , there will be an understandable focus on what the prime minister says regarding his nation 's role in that conflict . in the eyes of many in china and south korea , japan has never sufficiently apologized for its past transgressions , while the united states itself expressed disappointment over a visit abe made to the controversial yasukuni shrine . yet despite such criticisms , a pew poll found a plurality in the united states thinks that the apologies that japan has issued in the past about the war are sufficient . as a result , for much of the u.s. audience , abe 's words about the tpp will be of equal importance to questions of history . so , what will the prime minister say , and will his support for tpp be enough to sway congress ? certainly , abe has a lot riding on the agreement domestically ; he has faced opposition from agricultural interests at home who are usually firm backers of his ruling liberal democratic party , and could be hurt politically if the negotiations collapse . this suggests that the big challenge for abe on wednesday will be to reframe the debate over trade promotion authority and the tpp in a way that convinces the american people that the trade agreement is not about enriching u.s. corporations and outsourcing u.s. jobs , but strengthening the u.s.-japan alliance and establishing trade rules that will eventually help the united states and other countries combat the unfair trade practices of china . it 's a tall task , especially when it is unlikely the public will be paying much attention to his speech . but it 's a deal that will have significant repercussions not just for the deal at hand , but for the success of president obama 's pivot to asia . and with that in mind , prime minister abe wo n't be the only one hoping he can turn in a convincing performance on wednesday .b\\x1b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa93kabul , afghanistan -lrb- cnn -rrb- the flag is crude , handmade , but the message is clear -- allegiance to isis in afghanistan . and the timing -- with america withdrawing , the taliban fractured , young men disillusioned and angry -- could not be worse . a group of fighters in afghanistan agreed to be filmed by a cnn cameraman parading their isis flags in a valley not far to the south of kabul , the afghan capital . they are the first images of their kind shot by western media inside afghanistan . the rise of isis is an issue that the afghan president , ashraf ghani , has termed a `` terrible threat . '' u.s. officials cnn has spoken to have voiced their concern about the potential for an isis presence . one u.s. military officer said the militants currently have limited capability but are trying to recruit disillusioned taliban in several areas around the country 's east and south . `` there has been some very small numbers of recruitment that has happened , '' colonel j b vowell , told cnn . `` you have disaffected taliban who are losing politically and some of the younger , newer fighters are moving to that camp . it does n't mean it 's operationally better . we are concerned about it -- resources , weapons , capabilities . -lrb- but -rrb- i do n't see an operational effect . '' in the valley , the men display their weapons , and practice high kicks . they are a little breathless at altitude , a little clumsy . they are all masked , all in military-style uniforms . our cameraman described how locals seemed to keep their distance from them . it is often said that rivalry between the nascent isis presence and the taliban , who remain the big guns in afghanistan , is fierce enough to mean the isis fighters could be killed for brandishing the flag . but it is fatigue with the taliban that appears to have provided fertile ground for their rise . one of them told cnn : `` we established contacts with is -lrb- another acronym for the group -rrb- through a friend who is in helmand -lrb- in southern afghanistan -rrb- . `` he called us , saying : ` the is people have come to afghanistan -- let 's join them . ' then we joined them and pledged allegiance to them . '' our cameraman was n't allowed to film the satellite phones they say they use to talk to iraq and syria . they said they were religious students and deny any former association with the taliban . they said that at night they go into nearby villages to try and find yet more recruits . they watch a mixture of online propaganda , old and new , on their smartphones . the fighter went on to explain that they were currently talking to the taliban to determine whether they would work with or rival them . he added they are currently designating a new leader , after the supposed head of isis in afghanistan , abdul rauf khadim , was reportedly killed in a drone strike earlier in the year . for months , the afghan government played down the threat of a looming isis presence in afghanistan , yet during his recent trip to washington , ghani struck a different tone . `` we are the front line . the terrorists neither recognize boundaries nor require passports to spread their message of hate and discord . from the west , daesh is already sending advance guards to southern and western afghanistan to push our vulnerabilities , '' he told u.s. congress in late march , using the pejorative name used to describe the militants by many isis opponents in the region . there is some evidence to suggest that isis may already be operating in the country . a series of brutal attacks on civilian buses have baffled investigators in the past month . the first was in february , when 30 people from the hazara ethnic group -- shia muslims -- were abducted from a bus near zabul province in the south of the country . they have yet to return . another hit three buses traveling in wardak , central afghanistan , killing 13 civilians including women and children . suspicions have fallen on possible nascent isis cells as the taliban have vehemently denied responsibility for the attacks . khalil andrabi , the police chief of wardak told cnn of the bus attack : `` i ca n't hundred percent say that they were is , but their act was completely similar to what is is doing in syria -lrb- and -rrb- iraq . '' solid info on isis ' whereabouts in the country is hard to come by . cnn spoke to local officials from five regions -- some emphasized the growing threat of the terror group , while others played it down . zabul : mp abdul qader qalatwal says : `` people have seen foreigners from central asian countries and arab countries wearing black clothes and masks and having black flags in the districts of khak afghan and in parts of arghandab . '' `` those foreigners are rich , even carrying u.s. dollars . they have weapons and vehicles . some of them have even brought their families . '' nangarhar : mp esmatullah shinwari says : `` according to some reports , black flags have been seen in nangarhar 's haska mina district -- and a former taliban local commander , abdul khaleq , is now claiming to be isis ' representative in that district . '' farah : senator haji gul ahmad azimi says : `` according to the reports i have received from local officials in farah , a number of foreign fighters -- including women -- have been seen in the district of khak safid , wearing mostly black clothes , and some -lsb- with -rsb- the arabic headscarf . they have good vehicles and they are rich -lsb- enough -rsb- to buy food or goods at local shops for twice the normal value . '' `` they are said to live in the mountainous areas of the khak safid district in abandoned mud houses , and a month ago were rumored to be training in the area . i can not 100 % confirm they are isis , however . '' wardak : mp shir wali wardak says : `` i do n't think isis fighters from syria and iraq have come here to afghanistan -- but hardcore taliban members who have understood that the taliban name is dying have changed the color of their flags from white to black in order to stay alive . i know that some black flags have been seen in wardak province , raised by ex-taliban fighters . '' ghazni : deputy governor mohammad ali ahmadi says : `` there are ex-taliban fighters operating under the name of isis in ghazni province at the moment who have changed their flag from white to black . there have been armed clashes between newly-converted isis -lrb- members -rrb- and taliban fighters ... who should be in control of certain places .

'' `` i said ' i can help you make this fight happen , ' and he looked at me like , ` okay , i 'm listening . ' '' that 's when salvador told moonves his son trained at the hollywood gym owned by freddie roach , pacquiao 's trainer , and that he would put in a good word for moonves . at that point , salvador told cnn , he was driven more by his passion to see the fight happen than any real connection to roach . but he got roach 's phone number from his son , elijah , who was skeptical of his father 's plan . everybody had already tried , his son said . but salvador made the call and gained an audience in roach . `` i said , ` listen , i can help you make this fight happen , ' '' salvador said in an interview with cnn . salvador helped set up a meeting between moonves , roach and himself at scarpetta in beverly hills that he says began with a discussion about the legacy of boxing . `` mr. moonves said to me , ` if this fight happens , you 're going to be sitting there , ' '' said salvador . salvador 's role ended after that dinner . what followed was a series of meetings between moonves and both sides that eventually ended the stalemate keeping pacquiao and mayweather from entering the same ring . the may 2 fight -- on the pay-per-view services of showtime and hbo -- is expected to gross as much as $ 600 million . with that kind of money , and a smattering of media buzz around salvador 's story , inevitable questions circulated over what , if any , reward he should get , given the epic nature of the fight . when asked to comment , pacquiao 's team downplayed salvador 's role . `` for him giving les my phone number i do n't think he deserves a finder 's fee , '' roach told cnn . promoter bob arum said salvador `` got his 10 minutes of fame , '' though he called salvador `` a really nice guy . '' salvador insists he is not seeking money , and a cbs spokesman confirmed his role in the initial meeting . `` my reward will be sitting at the fight , '' salvador said . moonves made good on that promise -- salvador will be ringside on saturday night . `` it 's about taking a chance , '' salvador said . `` it 's about putting people in touch with each other and being able to sit back and say , ` wow , i planted that seed .

'' tamara cotman , sharon davis-williams and michael pitts also were ordered thursday to serve seven years on probation , pay $ 10,000 fines and work 2,000 hours in community service . baxter had come under fire from some community leaders for giving prison sentences to eight teachers and administrators who stood trial and were convicted of racketeering . they 'd been accused of taking part in an effort to raise tests scores at struggling schools by erasing wrong answers and putting in correct answers . outside of court , benjamin davis , the lawyer for cotman , questioned the judge 's rationale in handing down heavy sentences a few weeks ago . `` i had never seen a judge conduct himself in that way , '' he said . `` what was going on with judge baxter ? '' davis-williams said she was pleased judge baxter changed his mind . her attorney , teresa mann , added , `` we are happy . we are elated that judge baxter took the opportunity to reflect . '' cotman , davis-williams and pitts , all school reform team executive directors , got the harshest sentences during an april 14 hearing : seven years in prison , 13 years of probation and $ 25,000 fines . baxter said of his change of mind : `` i 'm going to put myself out to pasture in the not-too-distant future and i want to be out in the pasture without any regrets . '' during the earlier sentencing hearing , baxter was frustrated when defendants did n't admit their guilt . `` everybody knew cheating was going on and your client promoted it , '' baxter said to an attorney representing davis-williams . at one point he said , `` these stories are incredible . these kids ca n't read . '' at a press conference held april 17 , most of the convicted educators insisted they were innocent . `` i did n't cheat . i 'm not a racketeer , '' said diane buckner-webb , a former elementary teacher . all defendants sentenced to prison have appealed and are out on bond . the lower prison sentences given to other defendants -- ranging from one to two years -- have not been reduced . prosecutors said the cheating is believed to date back to 2001 , when scores on statewide aptitude tests improved greatly , according to a 2013 indictment . the indictment also states that for at least four years , between 2005 and 2009 , test answers were altered , fabricated or falsely certified . michael bowers , a former georgia attorney general who investigated the cheating scandal , said in 2013 that there were `` cheating parties , '' erasures in and out of classrooms , and teachers were told to make changes to student answers on tests . bowers said he heard that educators cheated out of pride , to earn bonuses , to enhance their careers or to keep their jobs . of 35 atlanta educators indicted in 2013 , more than 20 took a plea deal . twelve educators went on trial six months ago , with 11 convicted and one acquitted on april 1 . of the 11 convicted , two took a deal in which they admitted guilt , waived their right to appeal and received much lighter sentences . one defendant was giving birth during the sentencing phase not been sentenced . on thursday , baxter urged the defendants to engage in community service while they 're appealing . he said that might lighten the punishment if the convictions are upheld . the judge said he was tired of dealing with the atlanta public schools cheating scandal , which he referred to as `` this mess . '' `` i 'm ready to move on . so , anyway , adios , '' baxter said , and ended the hearing .\\x92\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' as police departments around the country see more protests over the use of lethal force , impd officials acknowledge that this is a time of `` increased scrutiny of police operations and tactics , '' but said the decision to change the uniform for certain ranks within the department is `` not related to any specific , individual incident occurring elsewhere in the united states . '' although it 's not a total uniform makeover , police officials said the white shirts will make command-level staff immediately identifiable to those who do n't recognize the rank badges on officers ' collars , the statement said . the new color will be worn by majors , district commanders , deputy chiefs , assistant chiefs and the chief of police . `` command staff personnel have the responsibility of publicly leading from the front , while being accessible to the members of the general public they serve , '' the statement said . `` those wearing white uniform shirts can and should be viewed as the final point of contact to the police department . '' some studies have shown that while any police uniform is usually perceived by the public as a sign of authority , lighter-colored uniforms may give a sense of goodness and safety .>\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' cnn spoke to several immigrants living and working in south africa about the crisis , which has caused south african president jacob zuma to postpone an overseas visit and left authorities scrambling to prevent further clashes . on tuesday the country 's defense minister said south africa would deploy troops to areas where police spread too thin in order to halt the attacks . zimbabwe immigrant stanley ndlovu says he is so frightened he dare not venture outside , not even to go to the local mall . he works in johannesburg as a cleaner and gardener , and also runs a small tuck shop where workers can buy food and basic supplies at his place of work . it 's a role he hears many south africans say should belong to them alone . he feels the south african government has been far too slow to respond to the violence , which has erupted intermittently in various cities over the past few years . `` to stop violence they need to arrest and sentence the perpetrators , '' he says . meanwhile , eric kalonji left the democratic republic of congo and arrived in the south african capital in 2012 , working as a waiter until the restaurant he worked at closed in january . now devoting himself to his studies in new zealand , he feels that the situation in south africa is more complex than a simple case of `` us versus them . '' he believes the blame lies heavily on what he calls the government 's failure to provide its people with jobs and education . `` this xenophobia thing is the result of a deeper malaise -lrb- in -rrb- south africans '' he says . `` a better policy from the government should be empowering the people with wider access to education so that they will qualify for the jobs that they say they deserve . '' opinion : labeling south africa turmoil ` xenophobia ' scapegoats poor blacks . kodwo amissah benyi , a hotel receptionist originally from ghana , now lives in the town of louis trichardt in south africa 's limpopo province . he 's far from the worst of the violence , but still close enough to follow the news with alarm . `` i fear it may spread because i do n't know what may spark unrest , '' he said . however he praised the government 's response to the attacks . `` the government is in crisis mode and pretoria -lrb- the south african government -rrb- is responding well by verbally condemning the attacks and showing force on the ground , '' he said .\\x7f\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xeb\\x1a-lrb- cnn -rrb- they left iran unwillingly , often in a hurry . it was for the best for these refugees . iran is a difficult place to be gay or lesbian . mahmoud ahmadinejad , the former president of iran , famously said during a 2007 trip to the united states , `` in iran , we do n't have homosexuals , like in your country . '' of course , they do live there , in fear of being discovered . homosexuality is illegal . you can be executed if convicted of engaging in sexual acts . kissing another person of the same sex can earn corporal punishment , like lashes . others have been pressured to undergo gender reassignment . psychologists in iran have reportedly pushed lgbt patients toward hormone therapy and eventually surgery . some flee the country before surgery , as do other homosexuals who believe they may be outed . many come to turkey , and the small town of denizli is host to hundreds of gays and lesbians from iran who are now in limbo . photographer laurence rasti , the swiss-born daughter of iranian parents , flew from her home in geneva , to denizli to explore her fascination with identity issues in iran . `` i could n't understand that in iran -lrb- homosexuality -rrb- is n't accepted , '' she said recently by phone from geneva . `` a lot of my friends are gay . and for me it was a huge cultural difference between europe and iran . '' rasti , whose yearlong project was part of her studies at ecole cantonale d'art de lausanne , said that when she first went to turkey , it was difficult to get people to pose . they did n't trust her motives , did n't trust strangers , she said . it was a process to become friends . she would talk to the potential subjects about their stories then discuss with them her ideas for what the photo would be like . `` i took a little part of their story to imagine a photograph , '' she said . there was another challenge . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` it was a work about identity even though we do n't see faces , '' she said . she hopes the images will give back to each of these people the face that their country has `` temporarily stolen . '' rasti , 25 , said once people understood her sincerity , and the anonymity of the project , they agreed to be photographed . rasti , a photographer for four years , used her mamiya 7 to give people a view into the spirit of these refugees . despite their status -- they can not earn a living in turkey and it take years to getting papers to go to a new country -- the refugees are still full of hope and love despite their rough lives , rasti said . it 's even more remarkable , she said , when you consider how they never imagined having to flee the land they loved and then lie to their families , many telling their kin they left to pursue their studies . most will eventually go on to a third country . rasti said she remains friends with some of her subjects who now live in canada . a few will return to iran , hoping to keep their homosexuality a secret . rasti hopes her photos spark dialogue . `` the reason i did this project is , i want use photos to talk about something that i think is important , '' she said . `` i wanted to let people know people know it is not unnatural . when people are afraid of something or do n't accept something , i think we should talk about it .

      "b\"\\x84\\x1alos angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- former rap mogul marion `` suge '' knight pleaded not guilty thursday to murder and all other charges related to a fatal hit-and-run incident in january in compton , california . his attorney asked the court to further reduce knight 's bail , now set at $ 10 million , but los angeles county judge ronald coen denied the request . the judge lowered knight 's bail earlier this month , to $ 10 million from $ 25 million , after defense lawyers called the $ 25 million figure excessive for the circumstances . knight faces one count of murder for the death of terry carter , one count of attempted murder in the case of cle `` bone '' sloan , who was maimed in the incident , and one count of hit-and-run . knight , 49 , faces up to life in prison if convicted . he is accused of running over the two men during an argument . in court testimony earlier this month , sloan , 51 , declined to identify knight as his attacker because sloan does n't want to be a `` snitch '' who sends knight to prison , according to cnn affiliates kabc and ktla . prosecutors offered sloan immunity , but he still refused to testify against knight during the preliminary hearing , the affiliates reported . the deadly incident occurred about 11 miles south of downtown los angeles on january 29 , after a flare-up on the set of the biopic `` straight outta compton , '' a film about the highly influential and controversial rap group n.w.a. . at the time , knight was out on bail in a separate robbery case . the alleged argument spilled over to the parking lot of tam 's burgers in compton . the hit-and-run was captured on videotape , which shows knight inside a red truck . in the video , the truck pulls into the entrance of the compton restaurant and is approached by sloan , who was working security at the site . the two men appear to talk for a few moments , with knight still in his vehicle . suddenly , the vehicle backs up , knocking sloan to the ground . while still in reverse , the truck moves out of range of the security camera . the vehicle is then seen zooming forward , back into camera range , running over sloan a second time , and then running over the second man , carter , a former rap music label owner . carter , 55 , later died . knight 's attorney matthew fletcher has argued that knight was the victim and was only defending himself against sloan , whom the defense attorney accused of possessing a gun at the time . fletcher added that knight 's defense was to stand his ground . the incident is the latest run-in with the law for knight , who founded the wildly successful death row records in 1991 and signed artists such as snoop doggy dogg -lrb- now known as snoop lion -rrb- and tupac shakur . knight was driving the car in which shakur was a passenger when the rapper was shot to death in las vegas in 1996 . shortly afterward , knight spent several years in prison for violating parole on assault and weapons convictions . that prison time -- along with shakur 's death , feuds between knight and a number of rappers , and desertions by dr. dre , snoop and others -- contributed to the label 's bankruptcy in 2006 . in august , knight and two other people were shot while inside a celebrity-filled sunset strip party hosted by singer chris brown on the eve of the mtv video music awards .\\x8a2\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xcc4-lrb- cnn -rrb- he was impressively polite and bright in the eyes of his boyhood teachers , an encourager of his college friends . he was a docile captured killer in the care of paramedics tending to his gunshot wounds . dzhokhar `` jahar '' tsarnaev 's defense team is seeking to spare him from a death sentence for his part two years ago in the boston marathon bombings and murder of an mit police officer . having focused on his dead older brother , portraying tamerlan tsarnav as harsh , overbearing and bent on jihad , they now shift to the younger brother who tagged after him , as one witness said , `` like a puppy . '' the sentencing phase of the federal case will resume monday . the jury was sent home thursday because a juror was sick . tsarnaev was convicted april 8 on all 30 counts , including 17 that carry a possible death penalty . the defense 's transition from one brother to the other begins in the ambulances that rushed the brothers from their respective final showdowns with police in watertown , massachusetts , on april 19 , 2013 . boston bombing survivor : i am not limiting myself . tamerlan , dying from gunshot wounds and having been run over by the car his brother was driving as he fled , became combative in the ambulance . a paramedic testified wednesday that it was common for patients in shock to become agitated and fight back . `` he had an abdominal wound , it was an evisceration , '' said paramedic michael sullivan . it was a `` penetrating wound , '' with the intestines protruding . `` every time we tried hands-on , he resisted that type of treatment , '' sullivan said . `` he was yelling , loud , like an ` rrrrrrrr ' type of thing . it was like he was trying to get out of the seat belts that were holding him on '' the stretcher . jahar , on the other hand , was cooperative after his capture hours later -- until a tourniquet was applied too tightly , said paramedic laura lee . he responded to questions , giving his date of birth and saying he was allergic to cats . and then he asked a question of his own : . `` where is my brother ? '' the defense showed a series of photographs that demonstrated how the brothers differed in size and age . the younger brother has been portrayed as someone who follows , rather than leads . one of tamerlan 's boxing coaches testified earlier that jahar followed his brother around `` like a puppy . '' the defense asserts that the boston marathon bombings never would have happened if it were n't for tamerlan . they have portrayed him as obsessed with jihad , spending hours in his computer trolling al qaeda-style websites . an uncle in russia told the fbi that tamerlan came there in 2012 , expecting to find `` jihad in the streets . '' magomed kartashov was questioned by the fbi after 40 days in a russian jail . the fbi summary report of the interview was read in court . kartashov said his nephew asked him if he had contacts with people `` in the forest , '' as locals referred to the jihadists . tamerlan 's information came from the internet , but he had surprisingly little knowledge of islam , the uncle told the fbi . when he asked his nephew why he wanted to go to the forest , he responded that `` jihad was necessary today , '' kartashov told the fbi . `` i told him to stop or he would n't make it to the next tree . '' jahar , on the other hand , was portrayed in the testimony of five of his former teachers as a smart , sweet kid who worked hard and earned good grades . he was `` super kind , extremely smart , a very hard worker , really a lovely person , '' said tracey gordon , his fifth-grade teacher at cambridgeport school . `` all the teachers loved him , '' said becki norris , who had jahar in her seventh-grade class at community charter school , a middle school in cambridge known for setting its students on the path to `` full ticket '' scholarships to good colleges . `` he was one of our top students , and one of our top athletes , '' norris said . `` he was n't a rebel . if you asked him to do something , he 'd do it . like most middle-schoolers , he 's need a little push , but he needed just one . '' but after just a few days in the ninth grade , jahar 's mother pulled him out of the school and sent him to cambridge rindge and latin , a large public high school . she was angry that her son had been sent home to change out of his blue pants . `` she was very , very angry because he did n't have clean pants that matched the uniform and they did n't have the money , '' norris said . `` i thought he liked the school , and i did n't think he wanted to go . '' norris said she asked jahar if she could call his mother . `` he flatly said , ` no , do n't call her . ' '' he made friends in high school , and a core group got together regularly for `` bro nights '' during their freshman year at the university of massachusetts dartmouth , two young women testified . they smiled at tsarnaev from with witness stand , but while he seemed generally more animated in court , he maintained his usual flat expression . `` he was loyal , fun , laid-back , '' said classmate tiarrah dottin . she said she had no idea he was listening to jihadi songs or watching al qaeda videos on his laptop . she bowed her head and wiped tears from her eyes as she stepped off the witness stand and took a seat in the audience . alexa guevara testified that tsarnaev `` was private about his family , '' and did not discuss politics or religion with her . she said when he spoke about the future he said he planned to transfer to the university of massachusetts amherst and study marine biology . he was a supportive friend , she added . `` he encouraged me to go to art school , '' she said . she showed him her sketches , and he thought they were good . `` he said i had talent and should n't let it go to waste . i should go to art school and do what made me happy . it made me feel really good , like somebody believed in me , '' she said . she ended her testimony with a memory of one of the last times she saw tsarnaev and the `` bros. '' it was march 2013 , during spring break of their sophomore year . they went out to eat and then drove to a spot by the charles river . `` jahar went over to his car , and he got a backpack and there were fireworks inside , '' she recalled . `` he set one up and ignited it . it did n't work . the second one did work . we were all whooping and hollering . jahar was jumping through the firework itself . he was being really silly . '' she sobbed as court recessed for the day , and her cries could be heard in the hallway outside the courtroom . boston marathon terror attack fast facts . cnn 's aaron cooper , ray sanchez and cameron tankersley contributed to this report .\\x01\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd6#-lrb- cnn -rrb- much like the ardent young royal-watchers of today , enamored by the duchess of cambridge 's very being , i was similarly captivated by diana , princess of wales when i was a youngster . she was a rare breed : stunningly beautiful , immediately accessible , witty , charming and endearingly mischievous -- she was one in a million . of course that was long before the , `` there were three of us in this marriage , so it was a bit crowded , '' interviews and tell-all books alleging suicide attempts and acts of betrayal , but back then i was unaware of her more scandalous infamy . i simply adored her ... i still do . as the world awaits the impending birth of william and kate 's second baby , potential names have become the topic of rampant speculation and heated debate . girls ' names are causing the biggest stir , as there seems to be a belief that the couple are expecting a princess . if the assumptions are correct , she will be the first princess of cambridge born into the royal family in 182 years . the birth of any baby is cause for celebration , but given recent changes in the laws of succession , her arrival would be a historical one . in choosing a name , titled royals tend to turn to the family tree , rather than a well-thumbed copy of `` 1,001 best baby names '' like the rest of us . traditionally they pick dynastic names , and there are plenty to choose from : elizabeth , alice , victoria and charlotte have all been frontrunners , but the sentimental favorite among punters remains diana . in a recent today show poll , 32 % of americans predicted the name was a shoo-in , and in the uk the bookies ' odds of a baby named after her late grandmother change almost daily as diana becomes an increasingly popular choice . that said , in the event the couple do welcome a baby girl , i would hope that they do not opt to name her diana . today diana 's name is as divisive as the very institution of monarchy itself : while some have virtually sainted her , others have been vehemently critical , accusing her of being childish , unhinged and self-serving . contrary to popular belief the queen was very fond of diana , but should her name be bestowed as a first name upon the baby , it would be perceived as a slap in the face to the monarchy . in the years since earl spencer 's scathing attack on the windsors at diana 's funeral , the nation has moved on and diana 's legacy has been celebrated . she has become a part of royal history . her memory has been preserved , and the royal family is once again enjoying a renewed sense of popularity . out of respect to the queen , charles , camilla and the baby herself the couple simply would n't do it . diana 's name conjures up both positive and negative responses the world over , and whichever side of the fence you 're on , the moniker seems to me an almighty burden for a newborn baby to carry . since diana 's death almost 18 years ago , william has honored his mother 's memory in a private and personal fashion . he has taken on many of her patronages and continued to champion her causes . at his wedding in 2011 the bishop of london , richard chartres , a close friend of diana and executor of her will , gave the address . the hymn guide me o thou great redeemer , which was sung at both diana 's funeral in 1997 and at the memorial marking the tenth anniversary of her death in 2007 , was chosen for the royal wedding . julia samuel , another close friend of diana , was asked to serve as godmother to prince george . william chose kensington palace , his own childhood home , to be the primary residence for his family , and in perhaps the most public acknowledgment of his mother 's memory , he gave kate diana 's engagement ring . william does n't need to name his second-born child after his mother in order to honour her ; he does so by being a good husband and father . i still miss diana . she was a one-off , and i do n't believe the world will ever witness another quite like her . daily comparisons to her late mother-in-law are already kate 's cross to bear . should n't a baby girl be spared the same fate ? diana 's tragic , untimely death and iconic status will ensure her memory is kept alive for generations to come . she would n't want her granddaughter to languish in her shadow . she would want her to go out into the world , to make her own mark and help those less fortunate , to enrich the lives of others and to carve out her own unique identity -- as alice , elizabeth , victoria , charlotte , or -- my own personal pick -- alexandra .\\xa8\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' magazine and newspaper editors are well aware of the dramatic rise in sales when a royal baby hits the cover , especially a little girl . and then there 's disney , which will always appreciate princesses in the zeitgeist , but as with all things relating to the monarchy , there is also a far greater historical significance should a baby girl arrive . there have been 34 kings and only six queens over the course of the british monarchy 's thousand-year history , and yet some of the nation 's most enlightened times have occurred when a queen has been on the throne . elizabeth i led the country through the golden age , and victoria and elizabeth ii -- the two longest reigning monarchs -- both made their mark with perhaps the most illustrious and progressive legacies of all . while it is unlikely this child will ever be crowned , as the daughter of the second-in-line to the throne , her role will be significant . prince charles has made no secret of his desire to slim down the monarchy , but in looking at his family 's immediate bloodline -- william , harry and george -- it stands to be a heavily male-dominated one . in an institution viewed by some as archaic and out of touch , it is imperative to have a strong female presence . princess anne -- baby cambridge 's great-aunt -- grew up with three brothers , and was once described as , `` the greatest king the country never had . '' she is patron of more than 200 charitable organizations and carries out some 500 public engagements a year . a noted equestrian , she won two silver medals and a gold at the european eventing championships , and was the first member of the royal family to compete at the olympics . more importantly she has supported her mother throughout her reign , flown the flag for britain and promoted brand windsor around the world . as the only girl born to elizabeth and philip , she has matched and often surpassed the accomplishments of her brothers . princesses beatrice and eugenie , also true blood princesses , are not `` working members '' of the royal family and generally only roll out for state and ceremonial occasions . so , yes , it would be nice for the baby to be a girl so that we can all ooh and ah over frilly dresses , fairy wings and ballet shoes -lrb- although as a windsor she 's more likely to be mucking out stables and shooting pheasant -rrb- , but in truth the birth of a girl matters on a far deeper level : the monarchy needs a baby girl to fill the female void of future generations . the 20th century was ushered in by queen victoria and the 21st by queen elizabeth ii . should george live to eighty-seven he will be the first monarch of the 22nd century , but as i have said before the british monarchy is anything but predictable . if punters are right and william and kate do announce the birth of a baby girl as the rightful `` spare , '' it 's certainly possible that a seventh queen may ring in the year 2100 . in the event the couple welcomes a boy , however , i sincerely hope there wo n't be a collective groan of disappointment heard around the world -- after all on the few occasions we have seen prince george he has been a veritable treat . the birth of any baby is cause for celebration regardless of gender , race , religion or indeed status , and as prince harry , the world 's most eligible bachelor has shown , games of naked billiards can sell magazines too . read more : please do n't name the royal baby diana .\\x93\\x0e\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xeb\\x1atehran , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- the basij is a militia made up of fighters loyal to iran 's religious leaders ; their mission is to protect the country 's islamic order . to do that , they will go to any lengths necessary , including -- they say -- taking on isis . `` we all are prepared to go and destroy isis totally , '' one basij commander told cnn . `` if our imam , our supreme leader orders us , we will destroy isis . '' the commander says that , so far , the basij has not been caught up in the fight against the feared islamic extremists currently waging war in parts of iraq and syria . but iran 's elite revolutionary guard 's quds force , led by general qassem suleimani , is already training , advising and supporting iraqi shia militias in their fight against isis . suleimani was accused of involvement in the shia insurgency against u.s. forces during the iraq war . today he is a celebrity to many iraqis and iranians . that is symbolic of the gulf that still exists between iran and the u.s. , regardless of any thaw in relations in the wake of the recent agreement on a framework nuclear deal and ongoing talks . iran , militias ' involvement in isis fight a mixed blessing . iranian officials , who believe their strategy is making a difference in the fight against isis , say they would like better cooperation with the u.s. , but point out that the level of trust simply is n't there . `` at the moment , we consider the united states to be a threat to us because its policies and actions are threatening to us , '' said general ahmad reza pourdastan , commander of iran 's ground forces . `` we would like the us to change its rhetoric and tone of voice so that our nation could have more trust in u.s. military leadership . '' and the feeling is mutual : the u.s. , which is leading the air campaign against isis in iraq , has denied any direct coordination with iran . iran will do what it takes to fight isis . iranians believe air strikes against isis are not effective , and feel that the u.s. and its allies are not trying seriously enough to defeat the group . iran 's president hassan rouhani told cnn 's christiane amanpour last september that `` the aerial bombardment campaign is mostly ... a form of theater , rather than a serious battle against terrorism . '' `` the battle in iraq is very important to iran , '' explained mohammed marandi , a professor at tehran university . `` the iranians believe that the americans , if they wanted to , could do a lot more to put pressure on their allies . and also , if they were serious about air strikes , they could do a lot more . '' it 's a point the u.s. , of course , disagrees with -- u.s. president barack obama has vowed to `` degrade and ultimately defeat '' the terror group . but iran remains unconvinced . `` if they want to destroy isis , it is possible for them to achieve that , '' said major-general hassan firouzabadi , iran 's chief of general staff . `` the u.s. military and intelligence organizations have many ways to strike at isis , but we have not seen anything so far except intelligence gathering from the u.s. and britain , '' he said . `` we hope that one day , because of their national interests and the will of their nations , the u.s. and the uk will decide to really fight isis . '' in isis , iran and the u.s. share a common enemy , but -- for now at least -- no apparent common strategy.will iran-saudi proxy war erupt ?\\xf5\\x0f\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf6\\x1d-lrb- cnn -rrb- actress linda thompson , bruce jenner 's second wife , says she can `` breathe a little easier '' knowing her ex-husband has found the strength to publicly declare he is transgender . in a two-hour special that aired friday , the olympic gold medalist and `` keeping up with the kardashians '' star said he has the `` soul of a female '' even though he was born with male body parts . thompson , who had two sons with jenner during their five-year marriage , was one of many relatives to cheer jenner for publicly sharing what she had known for decades . `` i have respectfully kept his secrets private and would have taken his confidences to my grave had he not spoken out , '' she said in a column for the huffington post . `` he can finally realize his need to be who he authentically is , who he was born to be . that takes tremendous courage . for that i commend him . '' thompson wrote that she would not have married jenner if she had known about his `` gender issue '' when they first met . but she 's glad she did n't know because she would have missed the chance to share a life with him , including their two sons . `` looking back , i 'm so grateful to god , the universe , and bruce that i did n't know , and that bruce played the role in my life that he did , '' she said in the column . the two met in 1979 at a celebrity tennis tournament at the playboy mansion , while jenner was in the process of separating from his first wife . the two married on january 5 , 1981 , and made hawaii their home . their first son , brandon , was born in 1981 , followed by son brody in 1983 . `` the bruce i knew back then was an easygoing , down-to-earth , casual , romantic , good and loving man . i was extremely happy to have found such a remarkable partner with whom to share my life . i found him to be honorable and , well , just too good to be true . just too good to be true indeed , '' she wrote . they were a celebrity `` glamour couple '' of the time , appearing regularly on red carpets , hosting charitable fundraisers and traveling the world together for their careers . jenner 's star grew , and was a man that other men aspired to be , and someone women wanted to be with . `` the bruce i knew back then was unstudied , affable , and seemingly very comfortable in his own skin . so it seemed . '' thompson said jenner told her in 1985 that , despite it all , `` he identified as a woman '' and hoped to move forward with the process of becoming a woman . '' confused and desperate , thompson suggested therapy to help her understand what he was going through and `` determine if it was something we could overcome or ` fix . ' '' `` i was pretty ignorant of the fact that being transgender is n't something that can be overcome , fixed , prayed away , exorcised or obliterated by any other arcane notion , '' she said . he considered traveling out of the country for gender-confirmation surgery and returning to the united states identifying as female , where his children could meet him as `` aunt heather . '' they separated after going to therapy for about six months and jenner began taking female hormones and removing his hair through electrolysis . as he started developing breasts , his children began to notice -- a claim that jenner also made in his interview . thompson says jenner did not remain a presence in their lives after he married kris kardashian , mother of kim , khloe , khourtney and rob kardashian . together , the couple had two children , kendall and kylie . thompson said she forgives jenner for those years . he has already `` been held prisoner in his own flesh '' and hopes that his life will get easier now . in addition to `` world 's greatest athlete , '' she hopes people will remember him as `` trailblazer for the civil rights of the transgender community .

      "b'\\xbe1-lrb- cnn -rrb- bernie sanders , my vermont senator and , indeed , a friend of many years , is now running for president . he noted at his announcement -lrb- with a familiar note of wise irony -rrb- : `` people should not underestimate me . \\'\\' to most americans , of course , sen. bernie sanders is only a name , if that . he is barely known to the general public , which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation . those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left-wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the senate , as we did in 2006 . let me add this , as someone who has followed him closely -lrb- and with admiration -rrb- for a long time : when people stop to listen to bernie , they realize that -- whether or not they agree with his ideas -- he is , without a question , an authentic voice who speaks without fear . and nobody should underestimate him . i remember when bernie was mayor of burlington ; it is the largest city in vermont -lrb- which is n\\'t saying much -rrb- . i met him then , and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before . he spoke with a throaty brooklyn accent , and he was jewish -- not your typical vermonter . he served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of lake champlain with remarkable energy for many years , listening closely to what people had to say , learning about politics at the local level , making a real difference in the daily lives of hard-working people . he was never a democrat -- and is n\\'t yet . he \\'s a progressive , holding his seat in the u.s. senate as an independent , although he votes with the democrats on major issues . when bernie decided to run for jim jeffords \\' seat in the house of representatives in 1988 , many considered him a long shot . i remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse , where bernie held the floor for almost two hours , answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce , funny , entertaining , passionate voice . bernie won that seat , again and again . make no mistake about this : vermont is n\\'t just a rainbow-colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets . it \\'s an agricultural economy , and bernie has understood this well . he has thoughtfully supported vermont \\'s dairy-farming community over many years . he has also been a strong supporter of vermont \\'s hunting culture -- much to the annoyance of many on the left , who wonder why the nra does n\\'t attack him . i was never prouder of bernie than during the run-up to the invasion of iraq . he was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the house , strongly opposing the 2003 invasion . he saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in american history , one with endless repercussions . he was especially outraged by the outing of former cia spy valerie plame in 2006 by an official from the pentagon , and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the iraq war in the first place . this was typical of bernie : the clear voice in the midst of the crowd , the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly . so what would it look like if , by some bizarre chance , bernie caught fire and became president ? he would certainly work hard for universal health care , which has been a passion of his . i \\'ve heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system -- the single-payer system -- that has worked well throughout europe for decades , reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well . he would not be wall street \\'s best friend . indeed , he did n\\'t support president george w. bush in his efforts to bail out the bankers , and wrote an open letter to henry paulson , the u.s. secretary of the treasury , protesting that bailout . famously , on december 10 , 2010 , he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the u.s. senate opposing the reinstatement of bush-era tax cuts , a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand bernie \\'s views . he is a socialist , of course . how many american politicians have ever said this aloud ? and what does he really mean by that term ? bernie knows what he \\'s doing . by proclaiming himself a socialist , he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks , many with international bases , have controlled american public policy for a very long time , usually to the detriment of working people . and it \\'s working people who seem mostly to interest bernie sanders . he has been one of only a few voices in the senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by `` millionaires and billionaires \\'\\' -lrb- one of bernie \\'s favorite mantras -rrb- have held sway over american politics for as long as anyone can recall . and this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads , serve meals , deliver the mail , drive trucks and teach in schools . as president , bernie would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change . indeed , bernie co-sponsored with barbara boxer the global warming pollution reduction act of 2007 . he has , for years , been a tireless advocate for the environment , aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad . but does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the democratic nomination ? and if he won it , could he defeat a republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal ? he \\'s not crazy . in fact , he \\'s probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes . but he ca n\\'t win , and he knows that . what he will do , however , is move hillary clinton on matters of importance to progressives : the restraining of wall street and large corporations , the scandal of how america allows its political campaigns to be funded and the welfare of working class americans , who seems pathetically easy to persuade -- again and again -- to vote against their own economic interests . a steep climb looms before him . but i applaud bernie sanders . i hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard .\\xf7\"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

      "b\"\\x9bD-lrb- cnn -rrb- i will always remember when things turned . i was 12 years old , and my younger sister and i were with our parents attending a peaceful demonstration in downtown miami near the courthouse . we were there to protest the acquittal of four police officers in the beating death of unarmed motorcyclist arthur mcduffie . i had learned the word `` acquittal '' just that day . it meant they would n't be held responsible . community leaders were gathered at the front , speaking to a crowd that was in shock and full of anger and despair . the trial had been covered extensively , and nobody could believe that the fatal beating -- with the extent of the physical wounds to mcduffie 's head and body -- could be justified or excused . i started to hear rumblings coming from around the perimeter of the immediate crowd . there was shouting and cursing . bottle throwing . then a car was turned over and set on fire . that was miami 35 years ago , but it could just as easily have been baltimore this week . the miami riots of 1980 were the first major `` race riots '' since the wave of riots spread across the nation in the 1960s . harlem 1964 : police shooting of 15-year-old james powell . watts 1965 : arrest of 21-year-old marquette frye for drunken driving . newark 1967 : police beating of john smith while under arrest . detroit 1967 : police raid on a `` blind pig '' after-hours bar . then the rev. martin luther king jr. was assassinated , and baltimore and 125 other cities erupted in flames . the immediate catalysts for the waves of riots in the 1960s before the death of dr. king were police action , or , more specifically , perceived unjust police action . that was true in miami in 1980 after the acquittal of the police officers . and the same in los angeles in 1992 after the acquittal of police officers for the beating of motorist rodney king . wednesday marks the 23rd anniversary of the start of the los angeles riots . and now we have baltimore 2015 , with the death of suspect freddie gray in police custody . my parents were leaders and participants in the nonviolent civil rights movement , and they raised me to understand that youths were the key to the movement . it was the images of young people all over the country -- often facing physical danger , discipline from their parents and suspension from school -- that propelled the civil rights movement into the national spotlight . juxtapose decades-old images of youths being hosed down by police during nonviolent demonstrations in birmingham and selma with tuesday 's images of baltimore youths throwing rocks at police , and you wonder what has happened . as a 12-year-old girl in miami , i did n't understand how people could injure and even kill others and destroy their neighborhoods , and risk going to jail , by rioting . i was afraid because i did n't see my father for days as he and other community leaders walked the streets to try to restore calm . i was also afraid that such senseless violence could only derail the legitimate causes of the african-american community , causes historically advanced by nonviolent civil disobedience and through legislative channels . but two months ago , i agreed to moderate a panel at the national center for civil and human rights called `` riot -- the voice of the unheard ? '' the occasion was to mark the atlanta premiere of `` detroit ' 67 , '' a play written by dominique morisseau and directed by kamilah forbes that chronicled the journey of a family as they lived through the turmoil of the detroit '67 riot , including the joy and love they found with one another . the play and the panel were programmed by kenny leon 's true colors theatre company , a nonprofit devoted to presenting artistic interpretations with diverse voices so that individuals and institutions can have a shared platform in their quest for understanding in american society . inspired by the mission , i had recently joined the board . although pegged to the past , the purpose of the panel was to examine how current events relating to police actions against african-american men could potentially lead to rioting and what could be done to prevent it . i learned that some questioned whether riots are actually purposeless and uncontrolled violence , or whether they are purposeful uprisings against individuals and institutions . i learned that those who participate in riots often feel hopeless and dehumanized , both as the victims of police action against them that triggered the riots and as perpetrators of violence during riots . i learned that riots in the 1960s played a role in advancing the civil rights agenda , often by galvanizing local and national government officials to work with peaceful community , church and civil rights leaders to address the root causes of riots . this is a controversial part of our civil rights history that has been sanitized . at the conclusion of the 1967 detroit riot , president lyndon johnson condemned the violence but said in his address to the nation that : `` this is not a time for angry reaction . it is a time for action , starting with legislative action to improve the life in our cities . the strength and promise of the law are the surest remedies for tragedy in the street . ... '' his administration convened the kerner commission to examine the 1965-68 riots , and its findings were that racism had led to joblessness , poverty , a lack of political power , unfair housing , police brutality and inferior schools . after the beating of rodney king in los angeles , the christopher commission was established and concluded that racial profiling and excessive force , unjust treatment in the criminal justice system , poor housing , and the lack of jobs and education were triggers for the riots . after all of these riots , the affected city , state and national governments enacted plans and programs to address some of these underlying conditions . maybe the baltimore youths involved in the riots felt the way one youth did in watts in 1965 . as recounted in `` the great rebellion '' by kenneth stahl , dr. king went to watts to try to calm tensions , and a hostile youth said to him : `` we won . '' king challenged him : `` how have you won ? homes are destroyed , blacks are dead in the streets , stores you shop from for food and clothes are destroyed . '' the young man replied , `` we won because we made the whole world pay attention ... the police chief and mayor had never been here . we made them come . '' dr. king would say near the end of his life : `` it is not enough for me to stand before you tonight and condemn riots . it would be morally irresponsible for me to do that without , at the same time , condemning the contingent , intolerable conditions that exist in our society . these conditions are the things that cause individuals to feel that they have no other alternative than to engage in violent rebellions to get attention . and i must say tonight that a riot is the language of the unheard . '' when i learned that baltimore high school students planned a purge based on the movie `` the purge , '' in which people were legally absolved for their anarchistic crimes , it suddenly made sense . they thought they would n't be held responsible for their crimes . they thought they would be absolved -- a word not much different from the word `` acquitted '' i learned the day of the miami riots . but they got it wrong . they will forever live the repercussions of their actions , regardless of the impetus . but the rev. jamal bryant got it right when he said he would open his empowerment temple ame church in baltimore to youths who would not be in school so he could teach them the power of nonviolence to change society . that power was evident after the shooting of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , and the decision not to indict the officer who killed him . those protests were mostly peaceful . and the government responded -- not out of fear of violence , but because of a desire to change the conditions that led to the protests . after several months of investigation , the far-reaching justice department report on ferguson issued in march concluded that the use of policing to raise revenue , combined with a systemic racial bias , had led to a pattern and practice of discrimination and fourth , 14th , sixth and first amendment rights violations against african-americans in ferguson . the report made recommendations that the ferguson police department , as well as other departments across the country , should enact to improve police relations in communities of color . the riots in baltimore have rightfully been quashed , but the voices of nonviolent protesters continue to be heard .\\t\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd4/-lrb- cnn -rrb- it 's time for liberals to look local . with washington gridlocked over almost everything and congressional republicans standing firm against any further expansion of domestic policy , the odds of congress passing another new deal or great society are minimal . it will take a lot of work by democratic voters and activists to change the numbers on capitol hill so that liberal ideas stand a chance of passing . yet at the state and local level , the story has been much different . liberal democrats have found more political space to move forward with their initiatives . in new york city , mayor bill de blasio has launched an ambitious pre-k education program to broaden access for all of the city 's residents . in new orleans , the mayor has put together a generous housing program to guarantee that there are no veterans without shelter . the drive for same-sex marriage equality took hold in the states before reaching the federal level . states such as vermont , oregon , and washington as well as new jersey have taken the lead in adopting eco-friendly policies . while congress has resisted president barack obama 's call to raise the federal minimum wage to $ 10.10 from $ 7.25 , 21 states and the district of columbia went ahead and enacted minimum wage increases of their own . this is just the tip of the iceberg . at the annual conference for new america in washington last week , the focus was on innovation . the most exciting ideas are taking hold at the local level . as the atlantic 's james fallows explained to the audience , when one moves beneath the gridlock of washington and down to the towns and communities of america , it is quickly possible to see the `` functionality of politics '' -- where partisanship does not trump the need to solve problems . this has given liberals an opening . in detroit , a company called detroit dirt is taking food scraps from local eating establishments and transforming them into compost for gardens to nurture communities and lower the environmental footprint of the city , pashon murray said at the new america conference . jonathan mintz , the founding president and ceo of cities for financial empowerment fund , explained how his organization assists local governments to develop global partnerships that help lower - and middle-income americans gain greater access to banking services . but many liberal democrats are uneasy about embracing this trend . since the new deal in the 1930s , which followed the total collapse of the patchwork of local and state social welfare programs overwhelmed by the weight of the great depression , doing things at the national level has been seen as the only way to go . only by making programs national could policymakers ensure that state and local government officials -lrb- particularly southern democrats who had little taste for giving benefits to african-americans -rrb- could not distribute benefits only to certain portions of the population . only the federal government had the taxing power necessary to sustain robust domestic initiatives . in this view , it was believed that only washington policymakers could bring together the best and brightest minds to make sure that programs were designed and administered well . only through centralized programs , could policymakers ensure that residents of one state did n't receive more meager benefits than in other places . some programs , like climate change , can only work well if every state has to follow the rules . for the time being , liberals need to abandon that bias . even if all the fears are warranted , right now there are enough benefits to justify more local programs . the most important obviously is simply practical . this is the only opportunity that liberals have right now of seriously moving forward with new ideas . local and state politics are also proving to be arenas for great experimentation . this is one of the lessons of the 1910s and 1920s , when liberal activists in states such as new york and wisconsin experimented with programs ranging from unemployment insurance to the regulation of work conditions . as supreme court justice louis brandeis wrote , a `` state , may if its citizens choose , serve as a laboratory ; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country . '' local policymakers and experts developed these programs for many years before they were ever brought to the national stage . the result is that the policies were stronger and better tested , and some of the bad ideas had been discarded after it became clear they did n't work . when franklin roosevelt came to office in the 1930s , he looked to these programs for inspiration about what to do at the national level . the same was true in the 1960s when lyndon johnson and the democratic congress put together civil rights , anti-poverty and urban development programs that had been implemented at the state level . it was easier for federal officials to build support for their proposals when they could point to successful experiments . voters could see how they could work and how some of the worst predictions of opponents had not come true . conservatives have done the same in recent decades . when republicans pushed for welfare reform in 1996 , they drew many ideas from local changes that had been put into place in states such as wisconsin , which had received waivers from national requirements . the local arena is usually not ideal for creating big domestic policies since it depends on so many actors to sustain , since the politics of each region vary so greatly and since the financial muscle of smaller levels of government is much weaker . outside washington 's more conservative environment , political conditions in many parts of the united states are producing important opportunities for liberalism to flourish . this vibrant period of local policymaking will help to prepare the groundwork for the next moment -- like the early 1930s or mid-1960s or during the financial crisis of 2008-2010 -- when the doors for legislating will open in washington .\\xc1\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xca!kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- when the earthquake struck , we huddled under a concrete beam -- and prayed . in another room , my grandfather could not comprehend what was happening and , instead of seeking cover , drifted towards the window . outside , a brown dust-cloud rose from the ruins of cottages that had dotted the next hill . i was at my uncle 's place in ramkot , west kathmandu , some 12 kilometers -lrb- 7.4 miles -rrb- east from my family home . after escaping the building for the safety of open air , my first thought was for news of friends and family . calls did n't go through but thankfully texts and data did . i heard from everyone except my mother . worried sick , i foolishly went into the house for a second time to get my belongings and leave for home . another tremor -- the first of many to aftershocks that have continued to strike an already traumatized city -- shook the house . i took refuge under the same doorway . the journey towards my family home in sifal was a map of quake destruction , with many houses -- old and new -- torn apart . a high wall surrounding a monastery had collapsed and the nuns had run to a nearby field . a mud-and-brick cottage had fallen on a blue motorbike but no trace could be found of its rider . a woman perched on top of rubble tried to reach for a water container from what used to be her kitchen . everywhere , survivors gathered wherever they could find open space -- fields , private compounds , empty roadside lots . in chhauni , an ice cream seller ran double-time with his cart , while his radio relayed the latest . further ahead , a mother and daughter sat down on a pavement so that a grandchild could be fed . across the bishnumati river , uphill towards maru , i ran to get away from the tall houses and made towards the kathmandu durbar area . it was reduced to rubble . a blood donation camp was said to be buried by the same structure that sheltered it . locals were searching for survivors , but progress was slow . the kasthamandap temple had caved in . temples that sat on impressive staircase-style pyramids were now dust . the western fa\\xc3\\xa7ade of the basantapur palace had fallen apart and nothing remained of the remained of the nine-story medieval palace nearby . meanwhile , the curio fleamarket was flooded with people who had made it out of the cramped quarters of jhocchen , indra chowk , new road , and nearby neighborhoods . in putalisadak , i met a cousin who was sitting an entrance exam for a prestigious high school when the quake hit before the allotted time was over . he kept wondering out loud whether he could retake the test . the two of us walked through bagbajar , trying to trace a few acquaintances , and up dillibajar to kamalpokhari . a hawker was selling momos -- a nepalese type of dumpling -- under a seven-story building , while policemen guarded a jailhouse . people gathered mostly in the middle of crossroads , on traffic islands and around metal pulpits , which looked out of range of falling buildings . the aftershocks kept coming . i reached home and found both my parents alive and uninjured . i could n't believe that our 30-year-old house was still standing . as i walked my cousin to where his parents were , we kept hearing rumors : `` more quakes forecast by experts for 5 p.m. and midnight . '' as if to confirm , tremors shook us at six and more would follow at 10 p.m. and midnight , with smaller shocks throughout the night . along the northern boundary of the former royal museum , the wall had collapsed and people had poured out of the uttar dhoka neighborhood onto the palace lawn . green military tents meant for two people were now packed with six and the army was trying hard to accommodate as many as possible . in thamel , an electricity pole had squashed an abandoned taxi . a few men took turns taking photos with the wrecked car . in kantipath , a handful of backpackers were discussing where to make camp . back home , my parents decided against going to the nearby sifal chaur football field where families were sleeping on plastic mattresses under rudimentary tents . instead , their tactic was to stay on the ground floor , be awakened by tremors , and then scamper to a corner of our garden that seemed relatively safe . i did not sleep a wink .C\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xe7\\x16-lrb- cnn -rrb- it all started by looking up . during an expedition through the brittany region on the west coast of france , photographer fabien le coq noticed an unusual tree . he positioned himself at the base of the tree and turned his camera upward , filling the frame with the trunk and its spindly branches . `` i 'm kind of a walking photographer , '' le coq said . `` i love exploring new places . one day i was taking a break during an excursion in the broceliande forest , looking for the best place to settle , when i discovered a small clearing with a tree without leaves . i stayed for hours looking around , taking some pictures and i found myself lying down under the tree . the tree 's branches were rising as if to touch the sky . '' this was the start of the photo series `` treesome , '' an embodiment of le coq 's unique way of interacting with the world around him . `` by walking a long time in an environment , landscapes begin to influence on your mood , '' he said . `` as -lrb- landscapes -rrb- change , your feelings do . '' the series , shot between 2012 and 2014 , reflects le coq 's travels through his native france and countries in central america and asia . the images are soothing and repetitive ; each tree is photographed from the bottom looking up . but it is from this vantage point that the differences become apparent . branches take on their own patterns in the sky , creating a symmetry that is both interesting and comforting . a row of trees shot in paris speaks to the geometry of a modern city . cactus branches look like spears piercing the sky . appearance is not the only factor that sets the trees apart . for le coq , each image is special because it represents different feelings at different points in time . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . `` each tree has its own personality , '' he said . `` i chose them by the way i felt at the moment . sometimes they even change my sentiments . it 's kind of a spiritual experience . '' le coq says his photographs are meant to bring about pause and reflection . the viewer should `` become a third actor in a scene with trees and skies . '' it is an opportunity to take a break and focus on our own individual journeys . `` treesome '' is shot in black and white , an aesthetic le coq says lends tension `` recalling the gulf on one side and the celestial heights on the other . `` the branches are the mirror of the roots . '' as a freelance graphic designer , le coq can work wherever there is an internet connection . he uses this freedom to travel , discover new places and grow as a photographer . photography has also allowed le coq to explore his home country . `` sometimes home is full of new possibilities , '' he said . `` you just have to look or change how you look .

      "b\"\\x87P-lrb- cnn -rrb- on the morning of april 19 , 1995 , a man parked a rental truck packed with explosives in front of the alfred p. murrah federal building in oklahoma city . at 9:02 a.m. , the explosives detonated , killing 168 people , including 19 children . this was n't the work of a foreign terrorist group . timothy mcveigh and terry nichols , former u.s. army soldiers , were convicted of the attack . mcveigh was executed in 2001 , and nichols is serving a life sentence . twenty years later , domestic terror threats range from white supremacists to eco-terrorists to anti-government extremists and radical separatist groups , according to the fbi . the fbi 's goal , of course , is to prevent `` homegrown attacks '' before they happen . unfortunately , this is n't always possible . when acts of domestic terror do occur , the fbi investigates and tries to catch those responsible . from mcveigh and nichols to eric rudolph to ted kaczynski , the fbi is often successful , but every once in a while , the suspects get away . these are the fbi 's most-wanted domestic terrorist fugitives : . it was september 26 , 1981 , when a crowd gathered at john f. kennedy international airport for an anti-apartheid demonstration . among the protestors , the fbi says , was donna joan borup , an alleged member of the may 19th communist organization . the radical group advocated overthrowing the u.s. government . the protest turned violent , and borup allegedly tossed a caustic substance in the eyes of a port authority police officer . according to the port authority , he `` lost all or most of his sight . '' borup and others were arrested and released on bail , but borup never showed up for her trial . an arrest warrant was issued in 1982 . today , she would be in her late 50s to mid-60s , standing between five feet four inches and five feet six inches . according to the fbi , borup `` is thought to have a photographic memory and is highly intelligent . '' the fbi considers her `` armed and dangerous . '' cheri laverne dalton is wanted for her alleged involvement in the brinks armored car robbery on october 20 , 1981 , when a group of political radicals associated with the black liberation army robbed $ 1.6 million from a brink 's truck in nanuet , new york . time magazine reported in november of that year that the attack happened shortly before 4 p.m. when brink 's guards peter paige and joe trombino loaded the money into their truck . suddenly armed robbers attacked . they opened fire , killing paige . trombino was seriously injured , but survived and kept working for brinks until he was killed in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks while making a delivery in the world trade center . according to the fbi , the robbers drove away after the brink 's robbery , allegedly meeting up with members of the weather underground -- another radical organization . they switched cars and drove off . following a tip , police caught up to them . a shootout left nyack police sgt. edward o'grady and officer waverly brown dead . hip hop artist tupac shakur 's stepfather , jeral wayne williams -lrb- known as mutulu shakur -rrb- is considered by authorities to be the mastermind behind the robbery . in 1988 , he received a 60-year prison sentence . he has a parole release date of 2016 . on november 17 , 1982 , a federal grand jury operating in the southern district of new york returned a superseding indictment charging dalton with various crimes related to the heist . dalton has ties to havana , cuba , and st. croix , virgin islands . according to the fbi , she is believed to be living in cuba . leo frederick burt , a 22-year-old aspiring journalist at the time , was part of a group that bombed a building at the university of wisconsin in 1970 to protest the vietnam war , the fbi says . it was classified as the largest act of domestic terror until the oklahoma city bombing . the explosion killed a physics researcher , severely damaged a building at the university and damaged 26 others . according to the fbi , explosives had been placed in a stolen truck three blocks from the building . burt was part of a radical anti-war group called the new year 's gang , the fbi says . angry over the vietnam war , the group targeted the army math research center in sterling hall at the university of wisconsin on august 24 , 1970 . on september 2 , 1970 , leo burt was indicted in madison , wisconsin . he was charged with sabotage , destruction of government property , and conspiracy . burt 's three accomplices were arrested and served prison sentences for the crime , but the hunt for burt continues . burt may wear glasses , and may have a mustache and beard . he has worn his hair long in the back , according to the fbi . he has ties to new york , boston , and peterborough , ontario . joseph mahmoud dibee and josephine sunshine overaker are thought to be among the last members of the eco-terror group known as `` the family , '' said to be affiliated with elf , the earth liberation front , or the animal liberation front -lrb- alf -rrb- . they are suspected to be involved in `` at least 25 domestic terrorism criminal actions totaling over $ 48 million in damages , including the largest eco-related arson in history , a $ 26 million arson at the vail ski resort , '' the fbi said . these alleged crimes occurred in oregon , washington , california , colorado and wyoming , and date back to 1996 according to the fbi . elf made no secret of its responsibility for the vail fire , and on october 19 , 1998 , issued a statement saying : `` vail inc. is already the largest ski operation in north america and now wants to expand even further . the 12 miles of roads and 885 acres of clearcuts will ruin the last best lynx habitat in the state . putting profits ahead of colorado 's wildlife will not be tolerated . '' other environmentalists denounced the fires , calling elf a fringe group whose actions did far more harm than good . on january 19 , 2006 , a federal grand jury in eugene , oregon , indicted overaker , dibee and two others -- since arrested -- on multiple charges related to their alleged role in a domestic terrorism cell . the fbi says overaker is fluent in spanish . dibee may have fled to syria . the fbi has led a long-running , multiple-agency criminal investigation dubbed `` operation backfire '' to combat violent elements of the environmental and animal rights groups , which remains open though not active . the case will remain open until overaker and dibee are located , apprehended and prosecuted , the fbi said . elizabeth anna duke is wanted for her alleged involvement in a string of crimes spanning the late 1970s through the early 1980s , according to the fbi . known as an active member of the radical group known as the may 19th communist organization , she was slapped with multiple charges . in may of 1985 , duke was arrested in bucks county , pennsylvania with alan berkman , who was wanted in connection to the 1981 brinks armored car robbery in nanuet , new york . she was released on bail , but fled in october . according to the fbi , duke is known to speak fluent spanish and has ties to texas but is also known to travel in the northern united states near the canadian border . she may have been travelling with donna joan borup who is wanted for allegedly throwing a caustic substance in the eyes of a port authority police officer during an anti-apartheid protest at john f. kennedy international airport in 1981 , the fbi said . william `` guillermo '' morales was an explosives expert who allegedly made bombs for an extremist organization violently advocating for puerto rican independence . the faln , translated as the armed forces of national liberation , claimed responsibility for or were blamed for 130 bombings , most of them in new york and chicago , in the 1970s and early 1980s that caused numerous deaths , injuries and millions of dollars in damage . morales was captured in may of 1983 in mexico , but was eventually handed over to cuban authorities , and the fbi thinks he has lived in cuba since june of 1988 . morales speaks both english and spanish . on july 12 , 1978 , morales was injured when a bomb he was working on accidentally exploded in east elmhurst , new york . badly injured , morales was taken to a hospital , and arrested . he was held at the bellevue hospital prison ward in new york until he was well enough to be transferred to federal prison , but escaped and fled . he is known to wear glasses and may have a beard . on june 3 , 1972 , western airlines flight 701 was flying from los angeles to seattle with 98 passengers and a crew of seven when willie roger holder and catherine marie kerkow allegedly hijacked the plane , threatening the crew and passengers with a '' bomb in an attache case . '' they demanded $ 500,000 , the fbi says . they were trying to force authorities to free angela davis , a prominent black militant , then on trial for murder , kidnapping and conspiracy in san jose , according to author brendan koerner , who wrote a book about the history of airline hijacking called `` the skies belong to us . '' koerner said davis was informed of the hijacking by the judge in her trial and refused to communicate with the hijackers . according to koerner , the ransom was paid in san francisco , where a little more than half of the passengers were released at the airport . the rest , he said , were released at jfk before the couple took off for algiers . it was a media circus , and the pair were dubbed a modern `` bonnie and clyde , '' according to koerner . `` basically the hijackers wanted to take angela davis to north vietnam , then head to australia to homestead in the outback . instead , they ended up crashing with the black panthers in algiers . '' on january 25 , 1975 , kerkow and holder were arrested in france when they tried to get in the country using fake passports , but the fbi says kerkow skipped out before her trial . holder was eventually extradited to the united states , but kerkow could be anywhere . the fbi says she may have ties to oregon , france , switzerland , algeria , jordan and cuba . opinion : homegrown extremist threat remains 20 years after oklahoma city bombing .\\xbd\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa6%hong kong -lrb- cnn -rrb- when she was growing up , mui thomas , wanted to be a fashion model -- not an unusual aspiration for a young girl . but mui suffers from a rare genetic condition that leaves the skin on her face and body red raw and open to infection . `` i really do n't think i knew that i did n't look like everybody else , '' she says . she was born with harlequin ichthyosis , which means her skin is extremely thick , dry and flaky -- resembling fish scales . she ca n't sweat but she can shed tears . on the day we speak , her appearance raises few eyebrows at her local starbucks in sai kung -- she 's a familiar and well-known presence in the waterfront hong kong town where she grew up . mui 's struggle to come to terms with her condition and other people 's reactions to it has , at times , left her on the brink of suicide . but , now 22 , she refuses to let it get in the way of her life -- she has a full-time job , plays sport and is embarking on a career as public speaker -- educating and inspiring others about the challenges of looking `` visibly different . '' after she was abandoned at birth , long-time hong kong expats tina and rog thomas began fostering mui , when she was just one and a half years old . they were told she did n't have long to live . `` we wanted to give her a family life in the time she had , '' says tina . however , mui began to thrive in a loving family environment and tina and rog formally adopted mui when she was three years old . together they gradually learned how to manage her skin condition . each day she bathes twice , ideally for two hours each time , and everywhere she goes she carries a backpack with three or four tubs of cream that she must apply throughout the day to stop her skin from drying out . she 's thought to be the fourth oldest person alive with harlequin ichthyosis . the oldest is 31 . but while mui 's unusual appearance made little difference during her early years , that changed when she started secondary school . the school she attended required that she be accompanied by a educational assistant , which put up a barrier between her and the other children and made it difficult for her to make friends . things got worse when she became a victim of cyberbullying . she began to deny her appearance , stopped bathing , taking her medication and applying the cream . at times , she considered jumping from the balcony of her home . `` they 'd say things like ` you should n't have been born ' -- and very personal things that only people who knew me would know , '' she says . `` it made me very wary of everybody . even when people tried to be nice , i did n't repay it . i did n't trust them . '' the worst episode lasted for 10 months and only stopped after police became involved and found the bully -- someone whom mui thought was her friend . mui left school with no qualifications . she says the school did n't push her to study and made too many allowances for her skin disorder . `` i still wish i had got a very hard kick up the backside from the teachers when i was n't doing work , '' says mui . since leaving school , mui has found a full-time job working with people with special needs and at weekends can be found running around a rugby pitch with a whistle -- she 's a referee for kids ' matches . along with her parents , she 's also begun speaking about her experiences of living with a `` visible difference '' and cyberbullying at schools around hong kong . her father has also written a family memoir called `` the girl behind the face . '' many have found her story inspirational -- a real life version of the young adult novel `` wonder '' by r.j. palacio about a young boy with a deformed face who enters middle school . on saturday , she will graduate from school assemblies and speak in front of a paying audience at a tedx talk in the city . her father is both protective and proud . he thinks public speaking will help mui come to terms with her condition but he 's also wary that she could be portrayed as a `` modern freak show . '' `` it 's difficult for her because she spent so long denying it . the more she confronts it , the more she is aware of it -- it will build confidence , '' he says . there 's even talk she might take part in a fashion show for people with visible difference , realizing a childhood dream . in person , mui comes across as articulate , poised and confident -- something her mom says comes out of spending so much time with adults while growing up -- and it 's easy to see how she could command an audience of hundreds . but after two hours of chatting in a coffee shop , she 's a little bored and keen to get back to her job . she flings her backpack over her shoulder and dashes off into hong kong 's crowded streets .\\x8b\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the european union is struggling to cope with an increasing number of people crowding into unseaworthy boats and trying to reach european shores . many of the travelers are fleeing violence and poverty in libya and elsewhere in the region . the capsizing of one vessel last weekend left an estimated 900 people dead . eu leaders are considering a plan that would involve military action against people smugglers at the source -- before they load their boats with human cargo . of necessity , such an operation would involve operations within the territory of north african countries . but haftar expressed dismay at the prospect in his interview with cnn . `` military action against libyan territory is an unwise decision , '' he said . `` you need to deal with the libyan crisis as a whole . we are a sovereign country that needs to be respected despite what we are going through right now . '' haftar did not respond directly when he was asked whether libyan authorities would confront any european forces within its territory . `` the european union needs to stand with the libyan people to solve the crisis instead of taking such decisions , '' the general said . `` the migrant crisis affects them . but why do n't they see that our problems are also very important ? it 's important for them to support us either on the humanitarian front or on the security front . '' pressed on the point , haftar replied , `` we do what 's in the interest of the libyan people . the european union is looking after its own interests so we will also look after ours . '' but he said libya is open to other kinds of cooperation on the issue of migration . `` if they take the right approach , we will certainly cooperate , '' he said , referring to eu authorities . `` the appropriate approach will benefit libya and its fight against terrorism . and i repeat , that means lifting sanctions against libya -- specifically those against the army .

      "b\"-lrb- cnn -rrb- a prosecutor has dismissed allegations that argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner tried to cover up iran 's involvement in a 1994 bombing in buenos aires . the move by prosecutor javier de luca to drop the case could mean a definitive end to the accusations that have roiled the nation , according to argentina 's state-run telam news agency . the case became of high interest globally after the original prosecutor who brought the allegations was found dead in january . alberto nisman was found dead days after making the accusations . his death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty . nisman alleged that argentina 's government agreed not to go after iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal . the 1994 bombing of a jewish community center in the argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country 's history . eighty-five people were killed , and hundreds were injured . a second prosecutor took the reins after nisman 's death and took the case to court in february . a judge dismissed the case , saying that nisman 's allegations did not hold up . following that , the case went to prosecutor de luca for a possible appeal . on monday , de luca announced that in his investigation he found that `` there was no crime here , either carried out or attempted , '' according to telam .\\x15\\x19\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b'\\xe0/-lrb- cnn -rrb- ciudad juarez , mexico , was once known as the murder capital of the world . back in 2010 , at the height of cartel violence , the city averaged 8.5 killings per day . but five years later , local officials say the city is much safer , and plans are underway to lure foreign tourists and investors back to juarez . this month the city launched the tourism campaign `` juarez is waiting for you . \\'\\' the rebranding effort started quietly a year ago , and on april 10 , it was on full display . mayor enrique serrano officially kicked off the campaign , giving what he called an `` unprecedented \\'\\' high-profile tour to regional leaders from the united states and mexico . u.s. rep. robert `` beto \\'\\' o\\'rourke of texas was one of those on a leg of the juarez tour . his congressional district includes el paso , texas , which sits directly across the rio grande . o\\'rourke says there \\'s good reason for locals to be hopeful . `` as a region , el paso and juarez represent 20 % of all u.s-mexico trade . the binational ties are strong and have remained strong , \\'\\' o\\'rourke says . `` yes , we had a really difficult time for a ... period . juarez was at one time the deadliest city in the world . \\'\\' o\\'rourke speaks of a time between 2009 and 2012 when men , women and children were killed indiscriminately . many were helplessly caught in the cartel violence . others were victims of the drug turf war . it was n\\'t that long ago , o\\'rourke says , that he thought twice about crossing the bridge into juarez . \\'\\' -lrb- now -rrb- i travel to juarez regularly to have lunch or meet people or just to go . i always feel safe and secure . \\'\\' a spokesman for the chihuahua state attorney general \\'s office told cnn that at one point , there were days when juarez had more than 20 killings . `` that was normal , \\'\\' spokesman julio castaneda told cnn . `` it \\'s safer now . \\'\\' the numbers from the attorney general \\'s office seem to bear that out . more than 3,000 people were killed in the city just four years ago , but so far this year there have been 89 killings , according to castaneda -- a dramatic decrease in the violence . `` undoubtedly , the work we did here in the past year with the police institutions , and specifically the local police , helped . there was a coordinated effort between agencies , \\'\\' castaneda said . `` without a doubt this work played a part in breaking apart the gangs that were plaguing the city . \\'\\' the government cleaned up corruption within the local police force , and fired or arrested a lot of bad cops who were helping the cartels . another factor that may have helped : the turf war between the juarez and sinaloa cartels essentially ended , with the sinaloa cartel claiming victory in the battle for the trafficking route in juarez . o\\'rourke argues that the el paso-juarez border is `` safer than it \\'s ever been . \\'\\' he cites the `` 30 million lawful crosses from el paso into juarez \\'\\' last year as a symbolic step . yet there are those who do n\\'t want to celebrate too soon . `` for juarez to be considered a safe city , there \\'s a long way to go , \\'\\' says sergio meza , executive director for plan estrategico de juarez , an independent organization that works to improve the city \\'s quality of life . `` just this past year -lrb- in 2014 -rrb- there were 424 homicides . in 2007 , there were 272 . yes , we \\'re not as bad . but we \\'re still very sick , \\'\\' meza told cnn from his office in juarez . `` in reality , we \\'re progressing from the conditions that were generated by the insecurity . we \\'re still working out the corruption in the city . it \\'s still an issue here . \\'\\' with more than 40 % of juarez living below the poverty line , according to plan estrategico de juarez , the future of the city will depend on `` the people \\'s participation in public matters . \\'\\' in fact , the organization \\'s slogan is `` nothing is fixed alone . participate . \\'\\' `` we are looking at a compromised future , \\'\\' meza said . `` we do n\\'t talk about that . we do n\\'t have the money to generate work here . \\'\\' one bright spot : u.s. investment is making a comeback . american companies delphi , honeywell , flextronics and lear are among those that ramped up hiring and investment in juarez over the last year . that hiring would have been hard to imagine four years ago . but with the average salary at $ 20 per week for local workers in the maquiladores , or factories , along the u.s.-mexico border in juarez , meza says more needs to be done . the scars from the recent past remain . several buildings downtown are shuttered and marred by graffiti . americans who , before the violence , came to juarez for bargain shopping have not returned in the numbers seen before the spike in violence . but in a sign of progress , the u.s. state department amended its travel warning for the city . while it still urges visitors to exercise appropriate caution , it \\'s no longer telling people not to come . longtime residents of juarez and neighboring el paso may be reluctant to say the wounds of the violent past have altogether healed . in the last year , however , they have definitely noticed that `` life is back . \\'\\' `` i measure it by the everyday coming and going of people , \\'\\' gustavo reveles , 39 , told cnn . `` for someone who grew up on the border and for someone who spent half of his life crossing the border on a weekly basis , it \\'s encouraging to be crossing back to juarez without that sort of hesitation or worry that something might happen . \\'\\' reveles lived in juarez until he was 15 and now lives in el paso . he says the threat of violence is `` still a little bit concerning , \\'\\' though that has n\\'t stopped him in recent weeks from going to juarez to meet friends for dinner and drinks . `` things have changed , \\'\\' he said . `` to go through what juarez went through , you see life there again . you see a semblance of what was there before . to really recover and heal wounds , there \\'s a long way to go , but the process has started and that \\'s a step in the right direction . \\'\\' cnnmoney \\'s octavio blanco contributed to this report .o\"\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n'\n",

      "b\"\\x8dBtokyo -lrb- cnn -rrb- with the world watching , in his historic address to a joint session of the u.s. congress , the first ever by a japanese prime minister , shinzo abe surprised nobody by missing a great opportunity to dispel worries and tensions he raises with his revisionist views on history . during this 70th year anniversary of the end of world war ii , abe has been disappointing on japan 's wartime history because he has been evasive and ambiguous about embracing responsibility for japan 's wartime actions in asia where the bitter legacies remain divisive . and this `` abenesia '' is harmful to japan 's international image , riles china and south korea and thereby undermines the bilateral security agenda . washington deliberately set the bar on history very low for abe because the obama administration is more focused on the shared perception with tokyo that contemporary china is a threat requiring a collective response . strengthening the alliance with japan and sealing the deal on the trans-pacific partnership trumps past misdeeds . forty years after the fall of saigon , and in the wake of iraq and afghanistan , america is in no position to lecture other nations about the horrors they inflicted and an inadequate reckoning for such misdeeds . president barack obama pulled out all the stops to give abe a red carpet welcome because he has delivered more on fulfilling washington 's longstanding security demands than all of his predecessors combined . but the newly expanded security role embraced by japan enjoys little support among japanese . as a recent pew poll indicates , only 23 % are in favor while 68 % are opposed . it is also problematic that abe 's stance on history is a factor in hindering trilateral security cooperation with south korea , something the u.s. sees as essential . carefully tailoring his remarks to his audience , abe hit the right notes in many respects , and even inched forward on history . he did express `` eternal condolences '' about the loss of american lives in world war ii , and noted , `` enemies that had fought each other so fiercely have become friends bonded in spirit . '' that is welcome news , but japan has been less successful in achieving rapprochement with other enemies , precisely because it has not taken the measure of the shared past . many nations play fast and loose with their unpleasant histories , but abe is mounting a significant retreat from japan 's repentant views expressed and embraced since the mid-1990s , and actively promotes a valorizing and exonerating history under the banner of patriotic education . he is putting his personal agenda on history ahead of the national interest and therefore not meeting the test of statesmanship . of course there is nothing that abe could say that would satisfy china or south korea , two nations that suffered longest and most from japanese depredations from the late 19th century . but that does n't mean he should n't try a bit harder . what abe said is , `` post war , we started out on our path bearing in mind feelings of deep remorse over the war . our actions brought suffering to the peoples in asian countries . we must not avert our eyes from that . i will uphold the views expressed by the previous prime ministers in this regard . '' essentially outsourcing `` apology and war responsibility '' to his predecessors gets low marks on the empathy and sincerity scale . it is also troubling that throughout his political career , abe has worked to undermine and repudiate previous mea culpa . rather than merely `` upholding '' what others have said it might have been better for abe to prove his critics wrong by clearly expressing an apology . in japan , there has been a lot of pressure on abe to explicitly invoke the language of the 1995 murayama statement that stands as the most forthright apology and acknowledgment of war responsibility . even the conservative yomiuri newspaper urged him to do so . murayama clearly condemned `` mistaken national policy , '' `` self-righteous nationalism , '' `` colonial rule '' and `` aggression , '' but abe has spent his entire political career renouncing this so-called `` masochistic '' view of japan 's wartime history . fatalistically , abe said , `` history is harsh . what is done can not be undone . '' well , yes that is self-evident but this should not mean the door is closed on apologies , acts of contrition and atonement and a clear reckoning of the harsh history that still isolates japan in east asia . abe is certainly right that the neighbors are playing the history card and relentlessly hammering japan on the anvil of history , but they were handed the hammer by japan . given abe 's evasive track record about the comfort women system of sexual slavery , a forthright apology or acknowledgment of state involvement was never in the cards . what abe managed , however , was even weaker than expected : `` armed conflicts have always made women suffer the most . in our age , we must realize the kind of world where finally women are free from human rights abuses . '' this cavalier `` sh*t happens '' attitude towards the comfort women system undermines japan 's dignity and represents a step backward . in recent remarks abe says he upholds the 1993 kono statement , but he has flouted it and over the past year members of his party have been busy controverting this forthright admission of responsibility and coercive recruitment . moreover , abe 's support for patriotic education and pressures on textbook publishers has effectively erased comfort women from what is taught in junior high schools , contravening what the kono statement promised . in the only textbook that does mention them , the government insisted on the removal of a former comfort woman 's testimony and insertion of a disclaimer regarding what it regards as a lack of evidence . to counter criticism , abe now refers to japan 's comfort women system in terms of human trafficking , a linguistic ploy to obscure state responsibility for operating this system and make it appear he gets 21st century concerns . human trafficking , however , highlights the role of private brokers in coercively recruiting these women in line with revisionist attempts to shift responsibility from the japanese military and government authorities of the day . revisionists prefer to blame the korean brokers , but they were acting at the behest of japanese officials who surely knew of the abuses and ensured that the comfort women could not escape their hell . in his speech abe also referred to shared values of democracy and freedom . this too is welcome news because over the past year abe has presided over an orchestrated attack on the asahi newspaper for its coverage of the comfort women system , packed nhk 's management with like-minded reactionaries and pressured critics out of their jobs . indeed the new york times ran an article on april 26 implicating team abe in the axing of a prominent tv pundit who made the mistake of criticizing abe . the foreign press has also exposed japanese government harassment targeting their reporting , especially regarding the whitewashing of history , and attempts to smear the integrity of those who would n't go along . in addition , journalists were told not to interview certain abe critics . journalists acknowledge this is what government spin doctors normally do and have done in japan for some time , but under abe the rules of engagement appear to be nastier . abe got lots of applause from u.s. politicians who seemed to enjoy his reference to an `` alliance of hope . '' that 's not exactly how okinawans feel about the disproportionate base-hosting burden they bear . some 75 % of u.s. bases are concentrated in okinawa and u.s. bases cover nearly 20 % of the land . in a series of elections and in opinion polls , okinawans have voiced their opposition to this situation . in november 2014 they elected a governor who opposes the building of a new airbase for the u.s. in the pristine waters of oura bay in northern okinawa , kicking the once popular incumbent out of office because he gave the green light for this project . officials on both sides of the pacific have reiterated support for proceeding with the new base as part of a plan to reduce the u.s. military footprint in okinawa , but okinawans remain unconvinced and find that the democratic expression of their opposition is resolutely ignored . shared values ??\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' the cargo spacecraft launched successfully early tuesday from the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan . but after it separated from the soyuz booster rocket 's third stage , russian flight controllers were unable to confirm the health of all the spacecraft 's systems , including the deployment of navigational antennae , nasa said . `` the spacecraft made another pass over russian ground stations and continued to experience telemetry problems regarding the deployment of navigational antennas and the pressurization of the manifolds in the propulsion system , '' the american space agency said in an update . a planned rendezvous with the iss six hours later was initially postponed to thursday but has now been canceled , nasa said in its latest update . `` docking has been called off for the progress 59 spacecraft , '' it said . `` russian flight controllers are continuing to assess the vehicle and what the plan going forward will be . additional information will be provided as it becomes available . '' few details have been forthcoming so far from roscosmos . according to nasa , the cargo ship is carrying more than 3 tons of food , fuel , oxygen , spare parts and scientific experiment hardware for the space station . but the hitch will not put the six iss crew members at risk , nasa said . `` the spacecraft was not carrying any supplies critical for the united states operating segment -lrb- usos -rrb- of the station , '' a statement said . `` both the russian and usos segments of the station continue to operate normally and are adequately supplied well beyond the next planned resupply flight . '' that next flight , which will be the seventh spacex commercial resupply services mission to the space station , is not scheduled to take off before june 19 , nasa said . meanwhile , russian flight controllers continue their efforts to make contact with progress 59 as it passes over russian ground stations . nasa said tuesday that russian flight controllers had `` confirmed that the vehicle had entered into a slow spin and have issued commands to attempt to control it . '' according to russian state news agency tass , six attempts to make contact were to be made wednesday . the u.s. supplies on board the spacecraft include spare parts for the station 's environmental control and life support system , backup spacewalk hardware and crew clothing , `` all of which are replaceable , '' nasa said . u.s. astronaut terry virts , from maryland , is the current space station commander . cnn 's eliott c. mclaughlin , suzanne presto and amanda barnett contributed to this report .\\xb6\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xf9 -lrb- cnn -rrb- you might call her a watchdog , because this boston area doberman really has a thing for timepieces . she recently ate three . last thursday , jeff courcelle came home from work to find 5-year-old mocha -- a pure bred fawn-colored doberman pincher -- hovering over a pile of screws , metal pieces , three watch heads and some chewed leather straps . `` my husband , who 's the most calm person that i know , called me up and said , ` i 'm not quite sure if i should panic , ' '' said courcelle 's wife , michele parkinson . the 80-pound doberman , whom her owners describe as `` more goofy than scary , '' had pulled down a basket of wrist wear from a shelf in their bedroom and eaten nearly all the contents . parkinson knew that mocha would n't be able to pass all that leather on her own . the couple took her to the mspca 's angell animal medical center , a 24-hour emergency and specialty hospital , where a veterinarian performed a 3-hour endoscopy to explore the contents of her belly . mocha was a repeat offender : just last summer , she got very sick and had to have emergency stomach surgery after a piece of plastic from an orange juice container perforated her intestine . she had 28 staples down her belly and 10 inches of intestine removed , parkinson said . fortunately this time , the jewelry remains were still in mocha 's belly and had not made their way into the digestive tract . the x-ray , however , was disturbing . parkinson and her husband were just expecting to see a couple metal pieces . `` it just looked like a christmas tree and i almost threw up , '' parkinson said . the veterinarian removed `` about a pound of leather straps and metal pieces and detritus '' during the endoscopy , and let nature take its course for the remaining pieces , mspca spokesman rob halpin said . as of friday , mocha was no worse for wear . the hospital sees dozens of cases each week of dogs ingesting foreign objects , and is trained to look for the symptoms of blockages -- typically lethargy , not eating and vomiting , halpin said . they once saw a golden retriever who had stopped eating and found 43 pacifiers in her belly . -lrb- apparently she was taking them from babies at the park . -rrb- and there was the 100-pound bull mastiff who ate his owner 's brie that was set out for a party -- along with the cheese knife . the night mocha stayed in the hospital , a nervous parkinson stayed awake reading stories about dogs ingesting watches and other objects . she found one article about a newfoundland whose owner knew something was awry only when he heard an alarm go off from his dog 's belly . `` we 've taken every imaginable thing that could fit down the gullet of a dog out with surgery , '' halpin said . `` there 's some evolutionary traits that some dogs have that lead them to eat first and think later ... and some of them are so food motivated that anything with a scent could be associated with food , and they go for it . '' mocha likes to suck on fleece blankets and has been known to eat rubber ear buds or hair elastics , but nothing like a pile of jewelry , parkinson said . her breeder wondered if the dog was acting out of anxiety . that day , parkinson had left mocha in a different apartment the couple owns that the dog was n't as used to . the breeder told parkinson that dobermans are particularly known to get anxious and do these sort of things . `` she had a dog that actually consumed her whole dog bed , '' parkinson said . from now on , parkinson said she will put mocha in a crate if the dog will be staying somewhere new . follow-up x-rays monday on mocha showed a few pieces of metal left , `` but they were moving along '' and the vet expected her to pass them naturally . parkinson said friday mocha was `` her playful , energetic , curious doberman self . '' but now that she thinks of it , the timing of this whole incident is a little suspicious . `` my husband was all excited about the new apple watch , but could n't justify a reason to purchase it since he owned three watches , '' she said . `` i am convinced that he and mocha joined forces here to destroy all of his current watches in order to make room for apple 's new watch .

'' that 's the question 26-year-old anamarie shreeves receives most often . it 's not exactly a typical question , but shreeves , who lives in atlanta and is the site manager for the nonprofit keep atlanta beautiful , lives what some may consider an atypical lifestyle : she creates almost no waste . the list of things she does n't use would send shivers up a consumer marketer 's spine : no plastic packaging , no new clothing , no metal cans , no cars -lrb- and in turn , no gas -rrb- . the small amount of waste shreeves does create goes straight into a 32-ounce mason jar that sits three-quarters full right next to her kitchen sink . its contents include produce stickers , some paper tea bag wrappers and a long , twisted piece of cotton that went around her toes for a recent pedicure . this is all the waste she has collected in nearly half a year . that 's right , everything . six month 's worth of garbage for shreeves is similar to what the average person generates in half a day . a maryland native , shreeves considered herself an `` earth advocate '' from a fairly young age . of her four brothers and sisters , she says she was always the one wading in the creek that passed by her backyard , climbing trees and pushing her family to stop being so wasteful . `` i got them their first recycling bin , '' she said . shreeves began her journey into zero-waste living two years ago . she had just quit her job working in television and decided to move to ecuador for a few months . before she left she resolved to get rid of as much of her stuff as possible . she had read a blog post by a woman who lives a zero waste life in new york called the no trash project , and she was inspired . `` the average person throws away a ton of trash a year , '' shreeves said . `` one single person . for her to go to zero like that , i was just amazed . '' upon her return from ecuador , shreeves decided to take the lifestyle she started before she left to the next level . in april of last year , she officially began to live zero waste . simplifying her existence was n't easy . she had to rid herself of old habits . in the first week , she filled up half the mason jar with paper towels after grabbing them to dry her hands , just out of habit . it also took a while to feel comfortable with the funny stares she would get after politely asking food vendors to put her sandwiches and salads into her metal tin instead of paper and plastic containers . but she stayed strong and a year later she is at the point where she composts , makes her own shampoo , toothpaste and even uses reusable feminine products . and yes , she does use toilet paper -- the kind that 's quickly biodegradable . the key to making it all work is an enormous amount of preparation . shreeves packs her bags every day with a cup to drink out of , a metal tin and a reusable fork and knife , a cloth napkin and a couple canvas bags . this allows her to avoid the waste that comes so often with prepared foods . she has also had to stop going to some of her favorite restaurants and coffee shops because they wo n't provide reusable kitchenware . shreeves acknowledges that with this lifestyle come certain restrictions ; she has learned to make most of her food from scratch to avoid packaging . she also has to put more time into getting places by bike or public transportation . but without a doubt , the rewards for her outweigh the inconveniences . `` the quality of life that i experience as a zero waster far exceeds my life before . it 's made me appreciate the things that i do have . i would n't want to be in another space , '' she said . to learn more about cutting down on waste , visit shreeves ' blog , fortnegrita.com .\\xae\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb5?washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- chief justice john roberts is back in the spotlight . roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case . the u.s. supreme court will hear oral arguments tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry . the question at the core of obergefell v. hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century , and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race . appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage , but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation 's highest court , led by roberts . appointed to the bench by president george w. bush , roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage . he dissented in united states v. windsor , a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the defense of marriage act , which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples . and he 's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans . yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice , and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally . they will be scrutinizing his words and actions tuesday for clues about how he 'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again . `` if the windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality , the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the roberts court , '' said judith e. schaeffer of the constitutional accountability center , which is advocating for same-sex marriage . `` will john roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision ? '' for some conservatives , a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment . it would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when justice david souter , who was nominated to the bench by george h.w. bush and who retired in 2009 , consistently voted with the liberals or when justice anthony kennedy , a ronald reagan appointee , disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty . or when roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government 's taxing authority . the hope in conservative circles is that roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people , not the courts . `` the chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the constitution , '' said edward whelan , president of the ethics and public policy center . `` blatherings about the ` wrong side of history ' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice . '' those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the windsor case . in his majority opinion , kennedy said the `` principal purpose '' of the defense of marriage act was to `` impose inequality . '' roberts disagreed . he wrote separately to say he thought congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide `` uniformity and stability '' at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman . roberts picked up on kennedy 's language that emphasized the states ' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday `` come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions . '' david cruz of the university of southern california gould school of law said that roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the obergefell case . `` roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage , '' cruz said . indeed , the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in michigan , tennessee , ohio and kentucky in the obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage . another clue to roberts ' thinking in the windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the defense of marriage act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the house of representatives and the senate as well as president bill clinton , who signed it into law . `` i would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry , '' roberts wrote . the comments suggest he would reject an argument in the obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people . but backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own . schaeffer points out that roberts did n't join the parts of the dissents penned by justices antonin scalia , clarence thomas and samuel alito , which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage do n't violate the constitution . `` roberts did n't join them in expressing those views , '' schaeffer said . at the time , roberts simply wrote that the court `` does not have before it , and the logic of its opinion does not decide '' whether states can ban same-sex marriage . schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that was n't before the court . `` but i think one reasonable explanation is that roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality , '' she said . the defense of marriage act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- hollingsworth v. perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage . the case concerned a challenge to california 's proposition 8 , a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage . but roberts , writing for the majority , dismissed the case , holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court . the ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in california . roberts ' lesbian cousin , who lives in california , sat in the courtroom during arguments in the prop 8 case . few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the supreme court , but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing windsor -- struck down the state bans . on the first day of the term last fall , the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue . conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases . but conventional wisdom was completely wrong . without comment , the court declined to take up any of the cases , clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages . the court 's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known . but some speculate on one possible scenario : roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in windsor . then again , even if the speculation were true , it does n't reveal much about roberts ' thinking . there 's a big difference between voting not to take up a case , which expresses no opinions on the merits , and issuing an opinion on the merits . and even when roberts ' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in california -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide , his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking . `` when the institution of marriage developed historically , people did n't get around and say , ` let 's have this institution , but let 's keep out homosexuals , ' '' roberts said during the proposition 8 oral arguments . `` the institution developed to serve purposes that , by their nature , did n't include homosexual couples .

      "b\"\\xed!-lrb- cnn -rrb- in a tragic echo of the catastrophic events in haiti in 2010 , a powerful earthquake struck one of the poorest nations on earth today . the latest estimates from seismologists put the magnitude at 7.9 , which would actually makes it about 40 % larger than the 7.8 currently being reported . that 's less than half the size of the previous major event nearby in 1934 , which killed around 10,000 people . unfortunately , it is quite possible the number of dead in kathmandu could rise to match it . we knew this disaster was coming eventually . geophysicists have long monitored how fast the earth 's plates are moving , and we know that the entire subcontinent of india is being driven slowly but surely underneath nepal and tibet at a speed of around 1.8 inches per year . it 's the reason everest exists . latest updates on nepal earthquake . over millions of years , the squeezing has crushed the himalayas like a concertina , raising mountains to heights of several miles and triggering earthquakes on a regular basis from pakistan to burma . saturday 's quake was neither unusual nor unexpected , although it was larger than most . in the 81 years since the 1934 bihar earthquake , the land mass of india has been pushed about 12 feet into nepal . think of all that movement getting stored in a giant spring lying under nepal . the spring is stuck on a broad , rough surface which we call a fault plane -lrb- a fault line is what we see when it emerges from the ground -rrb- . fallen : nepal 's historic landmarks . sometimes , energy stored in the spring gets big enough to slip catastrophically , releasing all that pent-up strain and generating shaking strong enough to destroy buildings and kill people over a huge area . the bigger the area that slips , and the larger the pent-up energy , the greater the damage . saturday 's slip took place over an area about 1,000 to 2,000 square miles over a zone spanning the cities of kathmandu and pokhara in one direction , and almost the entire himalaya mountain width in the other . a part of india slid about one to 10 feet northwards and underneath nepal in a matter of seconds . we have this kind of detailed data thanks to major advances in seismology over recent years . using measurements of shaking recorded on seismometers scattered across the world and sent in near or real time to agencies like the u.s. geological survey and to universities such as columbia , we can infer the location and magnitude of a big earthquake very quickly . avalanches hamper everest rescue efforts . not just that : we can now estimate the pattern and speed of rapid sliding across its fault surface . what used to take months of careful academic study now takes minutes of computation . in haiti in 2010 , although the earthquake was more than 20 times weaker than saturday 's , well over 100,000 people are thought to have been killed around port-au-prince by the shaking and its after-effects . yet despite some differences , the nepal and haiti earthquakes also share similarities -- both geological events were known to be approaching , and both struck areas afflicted by widespread poverty , rapid increases in population in urban areas , uncoordinated changes in building infrastructure and lack of adherence to improved building codes . about 1.45 million people live in kathmandu , the majority in poorly constructed homes not designed to withstand the kind of shaking seen on saturday . nepal has a per capita income of around $ 1,350 , only a notch above that of haiti , and among the lowest in the world . meeting building codes in new construction , or taking on expensive retrofitting , is way beyond the means of most . to make matters worse , the valley itself appears to focus the destructive shaking of earthquake waves . studies have long predicted that the kathmandu area was due a magnitude-8 earthquake , or higher -- one study predicted between 21,000 and 42,000 fatalities if a magnitude-8 .1 earthquake had struck the area . -lrb- fortunately , saturday 's shaking was half that intensity -rrb- . still , this catastrophe comes at a delicate time for nepal as it emerges from a long-running civil war and its economy has been improving steadily . we have to hope that recovery from both can somehow take place despite the enormous challenges ahead .\\xae\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfb'-lrb- cnn -rrb- atop the amazon bestselling books list this month sat an unexpected title : `` secret garden . '' it was n't frances hodgson burnett 's 1911 novel about a sour little girl 's magical place , making a book club comeback . it was a similarly named coloring book that adults were buying , for themselves , and it was n't the only one in the top 10 . johanna basford 's `` secret garden : an inky treasure hunt & coloring book '' -lrb- now at no. 3 on amazon -rrb- along with her second effort , `` enchanted forest : an inky quest & coloring book '' -lrb- no. 6 -rrb- ; `` balance -lrb- angie 's extreme stress menders volume 1 -rrb- '' by angie grace -lrb- no. 9 -rrb- ; and `` the mindfulness colouring book : anti-stress art therapy for busy people '' by emma farrarons -lrb- no. 8 on amazon uk -rrb- are selling at a rapid clip . though they can be used by kids , these and other new coloring book titles are being marketed to stressed-out , work-addled adults , who want to benefit from the quiet zen that a coloring session can bring . `` adult coloring is absolutely a growing trend and consumers are really taking to the idea , '' farrarons ' u.s. publisher , matthew lore of the experiment publishing group , wrote in an email . `` not only is it calming and good for your health , it 's just fun ! the demand is increasing exponentially as the word spreads . '' while farrarons and basford are based in the uk , the concept is taking off in the u.s. too , with the publication of titles like virginia-based art therapist lacy mucklow and illustrator angela porter 's `` color me calm '' and `` color me happy , '' created for the minds and motor skills of mom and dad , not the kids . the trend does n't seem to be letting up . basford is working on a third title , farrarons has been commissioned for a second book , and mucklow and porter will release `` color me stress-free '' in september . adults have long used crafts to unwind , but why coloring books ? why now ? it may have something to do with online access -- and , funnily enough , the desire to unplug . ordering a coloring book that suits adult tastes online is easier than walking into a bookstore where the only options have barbie or thomas the tank engine themes . plus , everyone 's favorite online crafting hub , pinterest , is a treasure trove of adult coloring pages , with themes ranging from nature and animals to classic paintings . meanwhile , like children , adults need a break from screen time -- and many are rediscovering the analog pleasures of coloring inside the lines . `` i 'm a grown-up , but i still love coloring books , '' novelist matt cain proclaimed in a piece for the guardian . `` if i switch off the phone , computer and tv and concentrate solely on choosing the right shade of blue , avoiding going over the lines and slowly filling up my page with colour , all my other concerns , i 've discovered , fade to nothing , '' cain wrote . the therapeutic benefits of art are nothing new ; it 's a concept that practitioners use with patients of all ages . atlanta-based art therapist susanne fincher , who has published several coloring books , said coloring can lift the mood , reduce anxiety and relieve stress . `` art making is a powerful intervention , '' fincher wrote in an email . `` neuroscientific research has shown that through the use of art therapy , the human brain can physically change , grow , and rejuvenate . '' true art therapy , she warned , should be administered only by a qualified professional . mindfulness and meditative coloring are recurring themes in the growing adult coloring book industry . a search for `` adult coloring books '' on amazon or barnes and noble will yield several books of mandalas , a ritual symbol in buddhism and hinduism that represents the universe , waiting to be colored in . `` i sometimes give clients one of my mandala coloring books for homework between sessions with me , '' fincher wrote . `` coloring mandalas can empower a client to manage thoughts and feelings on their own with the positive activity of coloring , instead of , for example , overeating or abusing substances . '' the opportunity to craft a mindfulness coloring book for adults was serendipitous for illustrator farrarons , who had been practicing mindfulness for a few years before getting the offer to create a book . `` in mindfulness , it is encouraged to break patterns in life by introducing variation to avoid the sensation of being on autopilot , '' farrarons wrote in an email while on holiday in korea . `` each page has been caringly designed with this in mind , so that the person coloring can hop at random from one pattern to the next . '' coloring books like farrarons ' pocket-sized volume bring a bit of calming and spirituality to the masses , but for some adult enthusiasts coloring is just a fun throwback to a simpler time , she added . `` it reminds me of hours spent filling in scenes from a coloring book as a little girl . in the digital age that we are in , surely , it can only be a good thing to pick up a pencil and feel young again .

      "b\"\\xa5$-lrb- cnn -rrb- whether quaffing artisanal cocktails at hipster bars or knocking back no-name beers on the couch , more americans are drinking heavily -- and engaging in episodes of binge-drinking , concludes a major study of alcohol use . heavy drinking among americans rose 17.2 percent between 2005 and 2012 , largely due to rising rates among women , according to the study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington , published thursday in the american journal of public health . the centers for disease control and prevention defines heavy drinking as exceeding an average of one drink per day during the past month for women and two drinks per day for men . binge drinking is defined as four or more drinks for women and five or more drinks for men on a single occasion at least once during the past month . the increases are driven largely by women 's drinking habits as social norms change , researchers found . in santa clara county , calif. , for example , women 's binge drinking rates rose by nearly 36 percent between 2002 and 2012 , compared with 23 percent among men . nationwide over the course of the decade , the rate of binge drinking among women increased more than seven times the rate among men . opinion : why are more women drinking ? `` it seems like women are trying to catch up to the men in binge drinking , '' said ali mokdad , a lead author of the study . `` it 's really , really scary . '' the study is the first to track adult drinking patterns at the county level . in 2012 , 8 percent of americans were considered heavy drinkers and 18 percent were binge drinkers . despite the increases in heavy drinking , the percentage of people who drink any alcohol has remained relatively unchanged over time , researchers found . madison county , idaho , reported the lowest rate of binge drinking in 2012 , at 6 percent , while menominee , wis. , had the highest rate , at 36 percent . hancock county , tenn. , had the fewest heavy drinkers -lrb- 2 percent of residents -rrb- and esmeralda county , nev. , recorded the most -lrb- 22 percent -rrb- . related : 1 in 5 high school girls binge drink . about 88,600 u.s. deaths were attributed to alcohol in 2010 , the researchers note , and the cost of excessive drinking has been estimated at more than $ 220 billion per year . the increase in binge drinking does n't surprise terri fukagawa , clinical director of the new life recovery centers in san jose , calif. , where 15 of her 24 treatment beds are filled with clients primarily addicted to alcohol . she said she 's seen more people seeking treatment for alcoholism in the past four years . still , she noted , `` there are a lot of people still out there needing treatment , but they wo n't come in unless they have a consequence like losing a job or -lsb- getting -rsb- a dui . they think they have control over it . '' public health experts offer a number of cultural and economic explanations for the increase in excessive drinking . as a result of changed social norms , it 's now more acceptable for women to drink the way men traditionally have , said tom greenfield , scientific director at the alcohol research group at the oakland , calif.-based public health institute . young people are more likely to binge drink , and affluent people have the money to drink more . so the influx of wealthy professionals in cities like san francisco , san jose and oakland -- many in hard-working , hard-partying tech jobs -- may have helped spur significant spikes in drinking rates in the bay area and similar communities , experts said . taxes on alcohol have not risen along with the consumer price index , so wine , beer and liquor have gotten cheaper over time in real dollars , he said . alcohol advertising , particularly for hard liquor , has increased in recent years . a federal trade commission study found that companies spent about $ 3.45 billion to advertise alcoholic beverages in 2011 . alcohol control policies , such as limits on when and where alcohol can be sold and how long bars can stay open , have weakened in past decades , greenfield said . that may partly explain rising consumption nationwide , particularly in some states where `` blue laws '' once prohibited alcohol sales on sundays or in supermarkets . to conduct the study , researchers analyzed data on about 3.7 million americans aged 21 and older from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system , an ongoing telephone survey of health behaviors conducted by the u.s. centers for disease control . kaiser health news -lrb- khn -rrb- is a nonprofit national health policy news service .j\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x93(-lrb- cnn -rrb- people have long underestimated the athleticism necessary for golf . but over the last decade , with fit golfers like tiger woods , adam scott , and now jordan spieth all winning the masters , the training perspective on golf is shifting . there 's a particular emphasis on the functional movement required to execute the perfect swing , which is why yoga is increasingly appealing to golfers . during the masters , spieth demonstrated optimal movement in two key areas that enhance swing power and fluid control while decreasing the risk of back and knee injuries : mid-back mobility and internal hip rotation . equally important , he did it while maintaining a stable low back and integrated core strength as the foundation for expressing his swing mobility . related : yoga for triathletes . remember tiger wood 's low-back problem earlier this year ? tiger blamed a lack of glute -lrb- primary buttock muscle -rrb- firing for locking up his back , but attempting to rotate from his low back instead of moving functionally from his mid back or hips likely exacerbated the issue . when golfers have mobility limitations in their mid back or hips , they compensate with their low back and knees , which not only hampers play but often leads to pain and injury . want the mobility to swing like spieth and avoid the back and knee issues that commonly plague golfers ? try these three yoga-based moves i use with my pga clients to address the key areas of the swing . trains internal hip rotation ; stabilizes and lengthens lower back muscles ; stretches upper back and shoulders ; encourages ankle mobility . start in a neutral all-fours position with your hips over your knees and your shoulders above your wrists . engage your deep core muscles to stabilize your low back . extend your right leg straight out to the side with your toes pointing forward and the sole of your foot down . exhale as you sit your hips back toward your heels as far as you can go comfortably without knee , hip or back pain . inhale as you bring your body weight forward again and internally rotate from your right hip to come up onto your toes -lrb- as pictured -rrb- . be sure the rotation is coming from your hip , not your lower back , knees or ankles . exhale and return your hips back towards your heels and the sole of your foot to the floor . repeat the movement in synch with your breathing through five repetitions on each side . promotes proper mid-back extension ; strengthens shoulder girdle , opens front of shoulders and chest ; lengthens low back . lie prone -lrb- belly down -rrb- on your forearms with your elbows under your shoulders . exhale as you press down through your forearms as though you are trying to slide your belly through your arms to create length in your low back . at the same time , move your shoulder blades down toward your waist . this will activate the mid-back muscles essential for thoracic spine extension while inhibiting the muscles of your upper neck and chest that limit mobility . hold the posture for three long , deep breaths . rest for a breath or two and repeat for a total of three holds . promotes thoracic spine rotation and shoulder girdle function ; stabilizes low back ; activates glutes -lrb- primary muscles of the buttocks -rrb- ; encourages ankle mobility , strengthens adductors -lrb- groins -rrb- , core and legs . stand with your feet together ; your big toes should touch but allow space between your heels to avoid externally rotating your hips . exhale as you sit back into a squat with your hands and forearms together in front of your chest . inhale as you hold the position , ensuring that your low back does n't arch , and your glutes and core are activated for support . exhale as you rotate from your mid back to place your inside elbow on the top or outside of one leg . keep your hips and low back stable . avoid separating your knees or letting one drop forward . inhale as you use your bottom elbow for leverage to reach your top elbow upward while pulling your hands toward the center of your chest . exhale as you focus on dropping your shoulder blades down your back and rotating from your mid back . you can look up or down -- whatever is comfortable for your neck . hold the twist for two more breaths . repeat on the opposite side . as an advanced option , you can hold one of your clubs -lrb- as pictured -rrb- , reaching your top hand up the club during the twist to open your shoulder and chest . adding these yoga-based moves to your workouts will help you develop the mobility for an optimal swing . but it 's up to you to add skill to the movement . to that end , there are many golf trainers who focus on body mechanics with skill training . according to its website , the titleist performance institute -lrb- tpi -rrb- educates instructors on `` how a properly functioning body allows a player to swing a golf club in the most efficient way possible . '' so , if you really want to swing like spieth , you might consider hiring a tpi-certified trainer since the training staff spieth thanked during his masters victory speech were all tpi certified .&\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' related : 9 worst eye care mistakes you 're making . macular degeneration is a breakdown of the part of the retina that allows us to see fine details in the center of vision ; while glaucoma damages the nerve that connects the retina to the brain , and is often caused by fluid build-up and pressure in the eyes . -lrb- barr said in the interview that she helps relieve the pressure by using marijuana , which is known to temporarily lower pressure inside the eye . -rrb- . `` it 's somewhat unusual that roseanne bar has both , but not unheard of , '' explains ophthalmologist steven a. shanbom , md , of shanbom eye specialists in berkley , mich. . though there are some controllable risk factors , certain people are genetically predisposed to these diseases , so barr may simply be prone to both . `` certainly it 's sad . the combination of the two is terrible . macular degeneration takes away her central vision , and glaucoma is taking away her peripheral vision , '' dr. shanbom adds . -lrb- he is not treating roseanne barr , and does not know the specifics of her case . -rrb- . the risk for both diseases goes up for everyone after age 60 , with some people , especially african americans , at higher risk in their 40s . that 's why the american academy of opthalmology recommends getting a baseline eye exam when you turn the big 4-0 , even if you have perfect vision . in the early stages , you can have either condition , but have no symptoms at all . things like a family history or high blood pressure , or issues within the eye -lrb- like having a thinner cornea , for example -rrb- might lead your md to prescribe drops that can reduce your chances of developing glaucoma by about half . related : 10 natural ways to lower blood pressure . there is no cure for either disease . but like those eyedrops , there are treatments that may delay the progression of early-stage glaucoma -lrb- from other drugs to surgery -rrb- , and therapies that might halt further vision loss in advanced cases of macular degeneration -lrb- including an implantable telescope -rrb- . the future looks brighter however : an animal study published this month suggests that an injection of stem cells into the eye might slow or even reverse the effects of early-stage macular degeneration . there are also simple things you can start doing right now to ward off these diseases . here , five ways to protect your peepers . slip on your shades -- even when it 's cloudy . sun exposure can up the risk for glaucoma and macular degeneration , as well as cataracts -lrb- clouding of the lenses -rrb- . make sure your sunglasses offer 99 % to 100 % uv protection . sporting a pair that does n't filter uv light is more dangerous than wearing no shades at all , because the dark lenses cause your pupils to dilate and allow in more harmful rays . schedule in a regular walk . studies indicate that aerobic exercise can reduce the eye pressure that leads to glaucoma , and may improve blood flow to the retina and optic nerve . according to the glaucoma research foundation , all you need to do is raise your pulse 20 % to 25 % -lrb- which could mean a brisk walk -rrb- for 20 minutes , a minimum of four times a week . related : 9 tweaks that make walking workouts more effective . eat your greens . spinach , kale , and other leafy greens are packed with lutein and zeaxanthin -- antioxidants that lower your risk of developing macular degeneration -lrb- and cataracts too -rrb- , research shows . another good source : egg yolks . snack on almonds , citrus , and berries . almonds are loaded with vitamin e -lrb- a handful provides about half your daily dose -rrb- , which slows macular degeneration ; while citrus fruit and berries are filled with vitamin c , which cuts your odds of developing the disease . avoid cigarette smoke . while smoking is bad news for many parts of your body , you may not have considered eyes to be one of them . however , smoking doubles your risk of macular degeneration . avoiding cigs can not only protect your lungs and heart , it can protect your peepers too .\\xe9\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc7\\x13-lrb- cnn -rrb- hawaii is poised to become the first state in the nation to prohibit the sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products to anybody under age 21 . the state 's legislature on friday passed a bill raising the minimum legal age -- currently 18 -- to buy tobacco or e-cigarettes . the bill will now go before gov. david ige , whose signature would make it law in hawaii as of january 1 , 2016 . forty-six u.s. states permit the sale of tobacco to anyone 18 or older , while alabama , alaska , new jersey and utah require customers to be at least 19 . dozens of cities and towns , including new york , have already raised the minimum legal age for tobacco purchases to 21 . `` this bold step will reduce smoking among young people , save lives and help make the next generation tobacco-free , '' said matthew l. myers , president of the campaign for tobacco-free kids , in a prepared statement . `` increasing the sale age to 21 will reduce tobacco use among youth and young adults , age groups when nearly all smoking begins and that are heavily targeted by the tobacco industry , '' he said . it was not clear monday whether ige would sign the bill , although on friday he approved legislation banning the the use of e-cigarettes in all locations where smoking is illegal . a spokeswoman for the governor told cnn in an email that he would need some time to review the bill . the legislation comes after a report last month from the institute of medicine that said barring people under age 21 from buying cigarettes would have significant public health benefits . setting the minimum age at 21 nationwide would result in nearly a quarter-million fewer premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer among people born between 2000 and 2019 , the report estimated . raise the smoking age ? report predicts big health benefits if we do . teenagers , especially those between 15 and 17 , are most vulnerable to addiction at a time when their brains are still developing , said the study , which was conducted at the request of the u.s. food and drug administration . if the minimum legal age for tobacco use was raised to 21 , the prevalence of smokers among today 's teens would decline by 12 % when they become adults , the report said . under the hawaii bill , anyone caught breaking the law would face a $ 10 fine for the first offense and a $ 50 fine or community service for a second offense . a 2014 survey of hawaii voters found that 71 % favored raising the legal age to 21 .d\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' since mid-december , 16 states have seen bird flu turn up in commercial poultry , backyard chickens , and in flocks of wild and captive wild birds , according to the cdc . that number will likely grow as birds with the disease fly from one state to the next . on monday , health leaders in iowa said more than 5 million hens would have to be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility there . in the united states , some 3.5 million birds had already been euthanized to prevent the spread of the disease , according to the usda . iowa has about 60 million laying hens , according to the iowa egg council and is the top egg producer in the country . california and minnesota , two of the country 's top 10 egg producing states have also seen cases . the news is bad for the birds , but not for humans . the cdc considers the likelihood of bird to human transmission of the virus `` low '' according to dr. alicia fry , a medical officer with the cdc national center for immunization and respiratory disease , influenza division , epidemiology and prevention branch . `` that said , human infections have occurred '' with another strain of the virus , found in africa and in asia , so the cdc can not rule out the possibility of human infection , fry said . `` we are cautiously optimistic '' that it wo n't spread to humans , but `` we are prepared for the possibility , '' she added . they are studying the current virus and creating candidate vaccines which could be used if one were ever needed . the usda is also working on a potential vaccine for the birds . these are typical routine public health preparedness measures . the cdc said it is also monitoring at least 100 people who have worked with sick birds . none of the workers have gotten sick themselves . most of the people who have become infected with the other strains of the virus in asia and africa have had direct or prolonged contact with infected birds . the virus does not spread through people eating chickens or eggs . birds that are sick die quickly , according to clifford . incubation period is three to five days generally . with turkeys , they go off their water and their feed when they are sick and become lethargic or have a condition called `` torticollis '' or `` stargazing '' he said , and they die shortly after that . farmers also see a drop in egg production . commercial growers have taken extra precautions to disinfect vehicle tires and any equipment that comes into contact with the birds . workers must also disinfect their shoes and hands when they go from building to building to reduce contamination . with popular backyard birds , the usda suggests people try and protect their animals from coming into contact with wild water fowl that may carry the virus . the cdc said , as with any evolving public health situation , they will continue to provide updated information as it becomes available . the good news is the virus does n't like warm weather or strong sunlight , according to the usda . so the cases should go down over the summer , but they are going to monitor the situation knowing that it could come back in the fall .\\xa5\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbf#-lrb- cnn -rrb- when the earthquake hit , many of nepal 's most renowned pagodas in and around kathmandu crumbled into rubble-covered stumps . others were smothered under splintered hand-carved wooden beams or multi-level rooftops . but the kathmandu valley 's other pagodas , stupas and shrines -- also built mostly of red brick hundreds of years ago -- suffered surprisingly little damage and remained standing next to structures which disappeared . the worst architectural losses have included the majestic shiva temple pagoda and its twin , the narayan temple pagoda , which dominated kathmandu 's main durbar square . from the late 1960s onwards , western hippy backpackers who traveled the legendary overland route to kathmandu would climb the shiva pagoda 's wide , nine-step plinth , sit in the shade under the triple-layered roofs , smoke hashish and enjoy the lofty view . but now the two pagodas have been obliterated and the scene comprises pathetic piles of rubble , a bulldozer shoveling a path for vehicles , shocked and miserable witnesses and a sense of irreplaceable visual and spiritual loss -- unless the structures are eventually rebuilt . the shiva temple pagoda may have been hundreds of years old , but before its destruction impoverished rickshaw drivers , coolies and others would publicly urinate into the gutter surrounding it while waiting for passengers or heavy loads to transport . the slightly shorter , triple-roofed narayan pagoda allowed vegetable sellers to display their foodstuff on the temple 's broad , five-level base . both pagodas also served as public platforms . jostling crowds of nepalis and foreigners used to gather there because the plinths ' height above street level allowed excellent views of major hindu processions and other events . those two landmarks fronted the enclosed dwelling place of nepal 's hindu virgin goddess , or kumari , whose ornate front of bricks , statues and carved wood seem to have survived the initial quakes . it is not immediately known if the inner courtyard and rooms are safe . on the other side of durbar square , the brick-and-wood shiva-parvati temple house -- where the hindu gods shiva and his consort parvati shelter -- appear to also have survived . on kathmandu 's outskirts the town of patan suffered terrible damage when its central durbar square lost several pagodas as structures pancaked straight down while others merely shook and cracked . fortunately others appear to still be standing , including the sundari chowk temple and a surviving lucky trio of holy structures : the gray stone , mogul-influenced krishna mandir ; the 17th-century bishwa nath mandir with its large stone elephants at the entrance ; and the nearby smaller 17th-century bimsen mandi `` god of the traders '' pagoda . several miles away from kathmandu , witnesses have been unable to immediately confirm the levels of destruction which have occurred in the lavish town of bhaktapur . the locality had undergone years of extensive restoration work thanks to foreign and local artists and funding . the town offset some of that cost by charging tourists a fee to enter its central area , which displayed refined temples , pagodas , shrines and even a restaurant built into a main pagoda , allowing diners to view the best sites while munching their meals . elsewhere in the kathmandu valley , the white-topped dome of the boudhanath stupa remains standing , but its smaller neighboring stupa has shown some damage from the quake . the boudhanath stupa is prized by tibetan buddhist refugees who have fled their chinese-occupied homeland on foot through the himalaya mountains . they are often seen reverently walking in a circle around the stupa 's base while twirling `` prayer wheels '' and chanting . there has been no news as yet on damage caused to other famous places of hindu and buddhist worship , including the hilltop swayambhunath temple on the outskirts of kathmandu . that imposing structure is popularly known as the `` monkey temple '' because its often vicious wild monkeys are allowed to scamper among the trees on the temple 's hill , terrifying visitors who have to hike up a lengthy stairway to reach the temples , shrines , shops and monks ' residences . . the fate of the pashupatinath temple complex near kathmandu 's international airport is also not known . pashupatinath 's multiple pagodas and shrines flank its public funeral pyres which emit smoke whenever human corpses are routinely cremated before the ashes are dumped into a narrow river .\\x95\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' lawrence painted this picture around 1940 . this is important to know because there are some people who blame president barack obama for racial tension in america as if the march on washington scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality . no. 22 was painted before hip-hop became the pi\\xc3\\xb1ata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement . some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort . it 's a lot easier to retweet a dr. king meme . it is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city 's police department began terrorizing its residents . we criticize baltimore 's mayor for not `` restoring order '' as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $ 6 million in a four-year span is `` order . '' now , some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie `` the purge '' for the uprising in baltimore as if the 1996 riots in st. petersburg , florida , happened on a different planet . or that the more than 100 cases of baltimore police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time . an 87-year-old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police , and sen. rand paul -- god bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash . it is true only 34 % of black children live in a two-family household today , and i do believe that is a problem . soul searching , as the president suggested , is something that needs to be had by all . but it is also true that 65 % of black children lived with both parents in 1960 , and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community . sen. paul 's rationale falls apart when you consider that john henry crawford iii was shot and killed by police at a walmart in ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children . crawford 's father was literally playing with his two grandchildren as his son was being gunned down . in 1971 , marvin gaye cracked the top 10 on the pop charts with `` inner city blues , '' which included the lines : . crime is increasing . trigger happy policing . panic is spreading . god knows where we 're heading . and yet so many look at the protests , uprisings and yes , sometimes riots , with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air . no backdrop . no historical context . television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue . it is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony . meanwhile , louisiana state police want people to believe victor white iii shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car . how can there be peace when the department of justice found black residents in ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt police department ? where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart ? and we know the impact wealth has on education , housing and mortality . now there is video of police in inkster , michigan , celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs , a head injury and bleeding . the officers fist pump and laugh . one of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of floyd dent , the man in custody . and when the incident in question was under investigation , the inkster police department suppressed the video . two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for . but at least we saw it . in chicago , the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17-year-old laquan mcdonald last october . the report said an officer fired shots into mcdonald 's chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife . witnesses said the shooting was unjustified . the autopsy shows mcdonald was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer . the city council recently approved a $ 5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing . the video could shed some light on what really happened ... which may explain why we have yet to see it . this comes on the heels of mayor rahm emanuel establishing a $ 5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former cpd commander john burge . for three decades burge and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock , burned and beat up more than 100 black men . and some look at baltimore and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from ? this mistrust did n't come from somewhere . it 's always been here . woven in the comedic deliveries of richard pryor , dick gregory and dave chappelle ; saturated within the prose of lorraine hansberry , maya angelou and shonda rhimes ; heard in soulful cries of billie holiday 's `` strange fruit '' to john legend standing on an oscar stage singing `` one day , when the glory comes it will be ours . '' for decades , the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated , the message remains lost . why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations ? that president obama is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by lawrence 75 years ago . before president richard nixon started the war on drugs . before eric garner started selling loose cigarettes in staten island . before baltimore became the setting of a critically acclaimed tv show . there is n't a new reason why freddie gray 's death triggered outrage . just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism .\\x81\\x14\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd1'-lrb- cnn -rrb- just about now , north korea 's enigmatic ruler was expected to be preparing to emerge from his fortified country for a visit to moscow to join celebrations next week marking the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii in europe . the trip was highly anticipated . after all , this was to have been kim 's first official international trip since he came to power in 2011 following his father 's death , and it would have provided a fascinating opportunity for the world to get a closer look at a young leader and a regime still largely shrouded in mystery . but this week , russia announced that the trip had been canceled , with kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov saying thursday that moscow was informed via diplomatic channels that the trip would not happen . he said that `` the decision is connected with north korean domestic affairs . '' what could have changed kim 's mind ? it is practically impossible to answer the question with absolute certainty , but a possible explanation is that kim may not be feeling completely secure in his position . and nervous dictators prefer to stay home . true , kim runs one of the most brutally repressive regimes on earth . and there is unceasing public praise for the younger ` dear leader , '' including frenzied eruptions of support . but these eruptions are carefully scripted , and those who have managed to flee the north confirm that in private , many are unhappy with the regime . perhaps with the potential threats in mind , kim feels the need to reassert his authority and keep his eye on the centers of power . in 2013 , kim shocked the country and stunned outside observers when he ordered the killing of his uncle , jang song thaek , who had stood by his side from the day his father died . jang had mentored and guided the young kim as he took the reins , but the once-powerful jang was arrested by soldiers during a politburo meeting who dragged him away in a chilling scene broadcast on national television . the central news agency called jang a `` traitor for all the ages , '' with vague accusations that he had behaved `` insolently . '' more seriously , he was accused of `` counter-revolutionary factional acts in a bid to overthrow the leadership . '' and just this week , and only a day before the russians announced kim 's canceled travel plans , a south korea lawmaker revealed that south korea 's national intelligence service had pieced together information suggesting that so far this year , kim has ordered the execution of 15 senior government officials . according to south korean legislator shing kyung-min , north korea 's vice chairman of the state planning commission , for example , was executed because he objected to plans to change the design of a new government hall from a rounded shape to one resembling a flower . such an explanation is bizarre . and in keeping with the odd behavior we have grown accustomed to hearing about from north korea . but there may be more to this . kim -- who was still in his 20s when he took power and holds a host of titles , including supreme commander of the korean people 's army -- still finds it necessary to remind everyone at home that he is the one in charge . but although there is something almost comical about the explanations offered up by north korea for the actions of its regime , a nervous , unpredictable , inexperienced leader with access to nuclear weapons is far from a laughing matter . as recently as 2013 , north korea conducted a nuclear test -- the country 's third , and it has threatened to use them against south korea , japan and the united states . meanwhile , it has threatened south korea with `` final destruction , '' said it will turn the country 's presidential office into a sea of fire , told japan it would trigger a nuclear attack if tokyo followed through on a warning to destroy any north korean missiles fired in its direction , and declared the united states is seeking a war and that pyongyang `` will be exercising our right to preemptive nuclear attacks . '' such rhetoric is itself troubling . but experts have also warned this week that north korea may have restarted its yongbyon nuclear reactor , with the institute for science and international security arguing that snow melting patterns in images of the plant suggest new activity at the plant . north korea has been mostly out of the news in recent months , partly because so many other international crises have pushed it out of the headlines . but that does n't mean tensions have eased . just three weeks ago , pyongyang fired missiles into the sea as u.s. defense secretary ash carter arrived on the korean peninsula . all this suggests that gauging the state of mind of the north korean leader is no easy task . but if kim raises the alarm about threats from the outside , we will know he is likely feeling insecure at home and may be trying to boost internal support . that would be a danger sign for the people of north korea -- and a flashing red light for the rest of the world . read cnn opinion 's flipboard magazine .\\xa4\\x1b\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa35-lrb- cnn -rrb- eternally blooming in kolkata , india , along the hooghly river is malik ghat , a wholesale flower market that attracts more than 2,000 sellers each day . photographer ken hermann visited the market for his project `` flower man , '' which is a series of portraits that casts light upon the people behind the petals . when hermann was in kolkata working on another assignment , he went to the market as a tourist . after that first encounter with malik ghat , his captivation with the market did not diminish and he became intent on returning . '' -lrb- the flower sellers -rrb- woke my curiosity . but at that time , i did n't really have the time to do the project , '' hermann said . `` and this idea just kind of stuck in my head for almost two years . '' hermann was able to spend about 10 days at the market , and did not allow any challenges to hinder the completion of `` flower man . '' he said that in addition to language barriers and the heat of kolkata making communication complicated and shooting at certain times difficult , another adversity he faced was taking portraits of the female flower sellers . `` i had a really clear idea before i went -lrb- to the market -rrb- about what i wanted to do , '' hermann said . `` i wanted to shoot the sellers -- the male and the female sellers . '' but none of the female flower sellers wished to be a part of hermann 's project , so he focused only on those who were interested in and comfortable with having their portrait taken . for the portraits , hermann sought a neutral background . he first tried shooting under a bridge near the market , but quickly realized the lighting did not match the mood he wanted to create . he then decided to create the portraits by the hooghly river . this allowed him to combine the hazy smog in the air , sunlight from above and studio lights of his own , which culminated to produce a surreal effect and overexposed look that made his subjects stand out . `` all the pictures are shot within noon and 3 p.m. when you have the sun straight from above , which gives -lrb- the portraits -rrb- this very hard light , '' hermann said . `` and then i just used some studio light as a fill to make it a little bit more soft . '' although the composition of the majority of hermann 's portraits encompasses the flower sellers in front of a neutral background , other portraits forgo this characteristic and consequently bring a sense of movement and fluidity to `` flower man . '' viewers may see people or a dog appearing in a frame , or even birds flying in the sky and a boat floating in the water . one of the reasons hermann did not create the flower sellers ' portraits directly inside the market is because of the hectic atmosphere . hermann compares malik ghat to the environments of financial trading and fish markets . `` it 's impossible to shoot at the market , especially if you want a clean and quiet background , because there 's so much going on , '' hermann said . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . similar to the commitment needed to effectively and successfully operate within the financial and food industries , hermann emphasized that the competitive atmosphere of the market and work ethic of the flower sellers was a major factor in whether a seller would agree to have their portrait made . `` all the other sellers -- they are so busy , so just convincing them to go near the river to get their portrait done and spend maybe 15 minutes of their time was a challenge , '' hermann said . `` because every minute they 're not standing in the flower -lrb- market -rrb- , they lose money . '' hermann said that another important reason some flower sellers decided not to be photographed was because flowers are highly valued in india and serve as a prominent feature during many events and moments in people 's lives , including everything from religious rituals and festivals to weddings and parties . `` some of the flowers , -lrb- the sellers -rrb- did n't allow us to take pictures of because they 're flowers used for offering in the temple , '' hermann said . `` it was more a problem about the flowers than actually the guy behind , because they did n't want us to take the pictures because -lrb- the flowers would -rrb- lose their purity . '' challenging perceptions and breaking down barriers are underlying elements within `` flower man . '' hermann said viewers must not make assumptions about the socioeconomic status of the sellers , nor should they view the sellers through a fixed , rigid lens regarding the behaviors and roles associated with gender . noticeable throughout the portraits is that none of the sellers is smiling , which is usually a behavior people tend to exhibit when in the presence of a camera . the lack of a smile enhances the organic nature of `` flower man , '' making the portraits a powerful representation of unforced and unfabricated human emotion . `` if you want to take pictures in india , people tend to just stand up and look proud and strong , '' hermann said . `` it 's very different from the western world because if you take pictures here , people tend to smile . '' like people , flowers come in all shapes , sizes and colors . when viewing hermann 's photos , this fact leaves viewers to consider if it is not the flowers that are decorations , but rather the sellers who bring vibrancy to the flowers . in the portrait of sanju joshi , for example , he is engulfed in endless layers of orange . `` they use these flowers in temples and all over india , so that 's one of the more common flowers at the market , '' hermann said . `` i really like that picture because they carry the flowers like it is a dress . you should see when they walk through the flower market , it 's almost like -lrb- the flowers are -rrb- all alive . '' similarly , the abundant leaves come to life in odhir gayen 's portrait . `` these are a special kind of leaves , and many of -lrb- the sellers -rrb- carry them on their head and -lrb- on their -rrb- arms , '' hermann said . `` and when they walk around , it 's almost like a human bush or something like that . '' hermann plans to return to malik ghat and looks forward not only to the opportunity to photograph different kinds of flowers -- as the range varies based on the seasons -- but also to the chance to present the flower sellers featured in `` flower man '' with their portraits . `` i enjoyed this project , '' hermann said . `` there 's a lot of photographers going to india and then showing a poor , bad situation . ... i have a totally different approach . i want to show some more proudness and find the beauty of people . '' ken hermann is a photographer based in copenhagen . you can follow him on facebook , twitter and instagram .\\xa6\\x10\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' f1 championship standings . hamilton had lost the malaysia grand prix in a strategic battle with the ferrari of sebastian vettel but it was business as usual in shanghai . rosberg came home second for mercedes to snuff out the threat from the chasing italian racers and renew his rivalry with hamilton . `` it was an important comeback for the team , '' said the 2014 championship runner-up . ferrari continued to put pressure on the world champion team with vettel finishing third to collect his third straight podium of 2015 . `` we just wanted to bring the podium back home , '' said vettel , a four-time world champion with red bull racing . `` it 's been three out of three so far so it feels pretty good . i feel happy in the team and hopefully we can get a little bit closer to challenge these guys . '' vettel is just 13 points behind hamilton in the world championship and four points ahead of rosberg , after the first three races of the year . rosberg unhappy . it was a disheartening weekend for rosberg -- the son of 1982 world champion keke -- and he allowed his frustrations to spill over for the first time this season . on saturday , hamilton beat him to pole position by just 0.042 seconds and rosberg complained to his engineers on the pit to car radio : `` oh , come on guys ! '' then the german insisted his race was hampered when he found himself sandwiched between race leader hamilton and vettel , both of whom had stopped for fresh tyres a few laps earlier . `` lewis is driving very slowly . tell him to speed up , '' rosberg told the mercedes pit wall . mercedes then instructed hamilton on the team radio : `` ok lewis we 'd like to pick the pace up a little bit . '' rosberg complained after the race that hamilton 's lackadaisical sunday driving was holding him up , pushing him back into vettel 's thrall and taking life out of his tyres . `` it 's interesting to hear from you lewis about your pace up front , '' rosberg said in the post-race media conference . `` that was compromising my race . driving slowly , that was unnecessary , and meant sebastian was closer to me . `` it cost me a lot of time ... i 'm unhappy about that of course . '' hamilton responded : `` it 's not my job to look after nico 's race . it 's my job to bring the car home . `` i did n't do anything intentionally to slow the cars down . if nico had wanted to get by he could have tried , but he did n't . '' bahrain . hamilton has won two grands prix in 2015 while rosberg has yet to climb onto the top step of the podium . if the german is to repeat his thrilling 2014 world title challenge , which went down to the final race in abu dhabi , he will need to turn things around soon . rosberg has the chance to exorcise his frustrations on track at the bahrain grand prix in just seven day 's time . ferrari will hope the hot track temperatures at the desert race will help them topple mercedes again , as they did on sepang 's sizzling circuit . the italian team have the horsepower . vettel finished less than three seconds behind hamilton in china with ferrari teammate kimi raikkonen fourth . there was also a small feat further down the field as former ferrari race winner fernando alonso finished his first race for the mclaren honda partnership with 12th place in china . the spanish double world champion missed the australian grand prix because of a head injury sustained in testing and then retired in malaysia .\\xcf\\x17\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xfe--lrb- cnn -rrb- pushed to his limits , a college professor took the extreme measure of threatening to fail his entire class . in an email to his students , irwin horwitz accused them of `` backstabbing , game playing , cheating , lying , fighting . '' the professor at the texas a&m university galveston campus expected his missive would create some conflict , but that it could then be resolved quickly -- and quietly . those hopes were dashed when one report by local media mushroomed into a tornado of nationwide coverage . the story went viral . suddenly , his name was spreading on twitter , facebook and reddit , accompanied by the kind of strong , unvarnished opinions that you can make about people you 've never met . he was a hero who taught today 's entitled youth a much-needed lesson , or an egotistical nightmare of a teacher who threw a fit . one thing was certain : he , and his employer , were now thrust into a spotlight that neither had asked for . `` i did what i did without any intention of seeing this in the news or seeing this on the internet , '' horwitz said . `` i will stand by what i did , but i 'm not career suicidal . '' texas a&m says horwitz remains an employee and that no one has asked him to stop teaching . but horwitz , a nontenure-track professor in the maritime administration program , is afraid the notoriety will cost him this job and future jobs . horwitz said his intent was not to be controversial , and the sharply worded email to students was not his first about the class . the day before writing to his students , horwitz wrote a similar email to the ceo of the texas a&m galveston campus and to the school 's chief academic officer . `` i have never in my capacity as an academic ever encountered a class as completely disgraceful , dishonest and disrespectful '' as his current strategic management class , he wrote to the administrators . he accused the students of shirking responsibility , making excuses and complaining their way to better grades . he would no longer teach the course and would fail the entire class , horwitz wrote . `` the class of graduating seniors is nothing more than a circus that is anything but academic , '' he wrote . `` but they are your problem now . '' it was the next day that horwitz wrote to the students , calling the class `` an embarrassment in general , '' and said that `` i am frankly and completely disgusted . '' once his words echoed in traditional and social media , the narrative -- angry prof flunks entire class -- might as well have been set in stone . the story was such a talker that even the onion offered a parody . `` i 'm not looking to fail students , '' horwitz said . `` i do n't get a bonus for failing students . '' `` the letter sounded a little bit more definite than i wanted it to , '' he added . he never actually changed anyone 's grade . there were some students he was n't going to fail , he said , and some who were on the border who could have pulled themselves out . but horwitz stands by his tough stance ; there was an issue of competency and of professionalism that had to be addressed , he said . the course in question is a capstone course for a maritime administration degree and is supposed to merge what the students learned in their other business courses . `` i had a large majority of people taking the capstone course who could not do a break-even analysis , '' the professor said . `` if you can not do a break-even analysis , then you do n't deserve a bachelor 's degree in business . '' his other complaint was about professionalism . horwitz said students would swear at him , cheat and spread rumors about him online . this is related to their grades , he said , because dealing with people you do n't like is a business skill . on online message boards , users claiming to be students in the class accused the professor of exaggerating the situation or fabricating parts of his story . one purported student called horwitz `` a little obnoxious , '' but said he is a good teacher and fair if you follow his rules . should the professor have been surprised that his email went viral ? the fiery language and strong allegations were likely to be news if the email went public , but maybe there is more to it . the situation hits on a popular argument on the media and internet : what do we think of millennials ? reflecting on his most recent class , horwitz said there is some truth to stereotypes of millennials as entitled and pampered . he mentioned the overdependence of students on cell phones and other electronics , and the power those devices have to interrupt concentration . the other factor is a failure of k-12 education , said horwitz , who has met college students who do n't know how to convert fractions to decimals . `` what i 'm trying to do is to give an honest assessment of their performance , '' he said . in a statement , patrick louchouarn , the vice president for academic affairs and chief academic officer at texas a&m galveston campus , said the entire class will not be failed . `` each student will receive an individual grade based upon work completed during the semester , '' louchouarn said . `` the university is listening to concerns about this issue from students and faculty and will address them according to our policies . '' the flurry of attention is unwelcome and horwitz fears it will affect his career in academia . but it 's likely his story will have a short shelf life . people probably will forget about it and turn their attention to the next grabby headline . but he said he thinks this episode will follow him everywhere . he said he feels a public shaming of sorts . online public shaming has become a research topic of its own . people who have been pilloried online for comments they made wonder if they will get a second chance . `` this is really destroying my life , '' horwitz said .Q\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xd3/gorkha , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- the ride from kathmandu to near the epicenter of nepal 's devastating earthquake is not for those who get easily carsick . steep slopes and small winding roads through deep river valleys greet us as we make our way to a town where nepalese and international medical teams are treating the injured , in much less than ideal circumstances . the view along the six-hour journey from the capital is deceptive . although i see numerous landslides , i am surprised that the villages we are driving through are relatively unaffected . during the entire journey , i notice only about 10 collapsed or seriously damaged houses . one of the biggest challenges rescue workers are facing in nepal is reaching affected people in remote mountainous areas . one of them is gorkha , a district northwest of kathmandu . the town we were visiting looks intact . some houses have cracks , and i see a few collapsed brick walls . most of the shops and businesses are open . but our first stop at the district hospital brings us into the full reality of the human catastrophe . the hospital campus is overflowing with patients . the facility is simply not big enough to handle such calamity . the injured are not from the town of gorkha , which lies near the top of one of the numerous mountain ranges . they are from northern part of the district , where some 200,000 people live . to accommodate all the casualties , the hospital built a tarpaulin shelter over the parking lot . at a time of our arrival , there are about 20 patients lying on mattresses on a dusty concrete floor . the youngest is 10 , the oldest in his 70s . most of them have visible wounds : deep cuts , bruised faces , broken arms and legs or spinal injuries . all of their faces with empty looks are still expressing the terror they went through and the pain they are suffering . mita gurung , 10 , sustained injuries to her face and leg when her house in the village of sinjung partially collapsed . her mother was injured in the tremor . mita is gently tended by volunteer child counselor tara may bishakarma . `` i just found what she likes and keep repeating it . her injuries are fairly superficial , but she is traumatized . it will take some time , but she will recover , '' bishakarma says . children usually get excited when being filmed . mita seems almost unaware of my camera . little food , less optimism in kathmandu tent city . the situation in the hospital 's emergency room is similar . every bed is taken . all the injured are taken care of by attentive doctors and nurses . some have family members with them . despite the gravity of the situation , the atmosphere here is calm . gorkha 's hospital is ill-equipped to treat more serious injuries and serves mostly as a transit point . here , the injured get necessary first aid and as soon as possible are transferred to bigger hospitals in other districts or in kathmandu . there are not enough ambulances , and most of the injured must travel on old buses . people unable to walk are transported on makeshift wooden stretchers . i can not even imagine traveling on the road we just came in with a broken leg or a spinal injury . the caws of crows above gorkha are frequently interrupted by sounds of helicopters . we leave the hospital and go to check the landing zones . one is a sports field , and the second a flat meadow on the ridge . many of the damaged villages are not accessible by roads . to fly to most remote places from gorkha takes about 30 minutes , five days on foot . the helicopters operated by nepalese military bring tents , tarps , blankets , food and baby supplies to most damaged areas . they bring back the injured . one helicopter brings two stranded danish tourists from chumchet , a village in the tsum valley . they are in a group of 11 trekkers from slovakia , poland and the czech republic who remain in the valley . most of the helicopters are small and can only pick up two to three passengers . we head back to the hospital , where we meet olivier hagon . he is the head of a mission of the swiss humanitarian aid unit , a swiss government agency . the agency 's `` mother and child '' team helps the needy during disasters around the world . `` for us , it 's most important to focus on the most vulnerable ones : mothers and children . women in labor who do not have a bed , women in need of a cesarean -lrb- section -rrb- without access to surgery facilities , '' says hagon . the rest of the 10-member unit arrives from kathmandu in the evening . the team includes a pediatrician , a pediatric surgeon , an orthopedic surgeon , a midwife , an anesthesiologist and a gynecologist . within two hours , they set up two modern fully functioning operating theaters at the hospital . the group 's philosophy is `` to support , not to invade . '' they work very closely with staff of gorkha 's hospital . the swiss humanitarian aid unit is followed by 26 members of the international search and rescue germany . they bring seven search dogs . leader thomas laackmann explains : `` right now we focus on finding survivors . the chances are diminishing every hour . members of our team are trained medics . we will also assist with treating the injured . '' all aid workers sleep in tents on hospital premises . on thursday , we wake up to a drizzly morning . heavy fog blankets surrounding slopes and mountains . all helicopter flights are suspended . people in remote areas desperately awaiting help wo n't get any today . but here in gorkha , humanitarian teams are at full speed . swiss doctors along with their nepalese colleagues perform surgeries . the german team heads off in a bus to villages reachable by road . we wish our hosts in gorkha the best of luck and leave for kathmandu mid-afternoon . i had come to see how serious the situation is and how local and state authorities are coping . i am too overwhelmed and too exhausted to draw any conclusions . but i learned a lot about resilience of the nepalese and about good people from around the world committed to help them . much help will be needed .\\xf1 \\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbd@-lrb- cnn -rrb- be afraid -- be very afraid . this is the warning the world deserves to hear . because the leader of the free world refuses to look with clear eyes at the chief security challenges of the 21st century : the fruits of radical islam . the results of the obama white house 's innovative efforts to make the world a better place can be accounted for in the ever-growing numbers of victims of radical islam in the middle east , north africa and south asia . not to mention here in the united states , canada and europe . is it not a tragic irony that the arab spring-era policies of a nobel peace prize recipient accommodated the transition of syria into the world 's newest jihad theater while leaving libya a failed state and yemen a failing state ? the syrian jihad gave rise to the islamic state in iraq and syria , which now uses syria as a rear operating base to support its jihad in iraq , which could soon spill over into jordan . plus , libya is now being used as a rear operating base by isis and other global jihadist elements striving to redraw the map of the middle east , even as they plan attacks in europe and north america . given the frightfully slow pace america 's commander-in-chief is currently allowing our military and intelligence community to take action against both isis and its progenitor , al qaeda , the picture of what 's in store is clear : the body count will continue to grow in the places where these groups can generate buy-in for their agendas . and neither the united states nor our western allies are immune to this cancer . academics who must say something new or different to garner interest in their work may describe the agendas of isis and al qaeda as distinctly different . but the fact is they are not -- their agendas , which constitute the foremost threats to the global security environment today , are manifestations of radical islam . of course , it 's hardly a surprise president barack obama refuses to acknowledge all this in plain terms -- the president and his national security advisers have too often proven na\\xc3\\xafve , with a dangerous habit of viewing the world not as it is , but as they hope it could be . there is no shortage of examples that highlight the absence of sound foresight on the parts of the world 's most powerful politician and his national security team . just take the national strategy for counterterrorism published by the white house in 2011 . that document contained the assertion that , `` since the beginning of 2011 , the transformative change sweeping north africa and the middle east -- along with the death of osama bin laden -- has further changed the nature of the terrorist threat , par-ticularly as the relevance of al qaeda and its ideology has been further diminished . '' yet , fast forward to january 2014 and america 's top intelligence official , director of national intelligence james clapper , advised congress that al qaeda was no less capable of threatening the united states and our allies than a decade earlier . soon after clapper acknowledged al qaeda was not a band on the run , as president obama had described the terrorist enterprise , a report by terrorism expert seth jones of the rand corporation highlighted yet another inconvenient truth for the white house : as restraints on freedom of expression of radical religious views vanished in places like libya , tunisia and egypt during the arab spring , those states became fertile recruitment grounds for terrorist groups -- including al qaeda and groups aligned with it . according to data compiled by jones , from 2010 through 2013 , the number of salafi jihadist groups increased by 58 % . these groups are fueled by salafiyya jihadiyya , an ideology that not only informs the agenda of al qaeda , but is the source code for the agenda of the al qaeda offshoot isis . most recently , absent from the national security strategy produced by the obama white house in february 2015 is any real meaningful discussion concerning threats posed by al qaeda . yes , osama bin laden was killed on president obama 's watch . but contrary to what the white house seemed to think in 2011 , bin laden 's death has not lifted the shadow he casts over america 's , or our allies ' security . indeed , within days of our new national security strategy 's publication date , in the seventh issue of isis 's english-language magazine dabiq , the group 's leaders described their jihad as a continuation of the jihad charted by bin laden , while accusing his successor , ayman al-zawahiri , of steering al qaeda off the path of its former leader . meanwhile , yemen -- home to al qaeda in the arabian peninsula , the al qaeda branch that claimed credit for the january 2015 attack in paris at the office of charlie hebdo -- has also become a failed state . aqap is helmed by the second-highest-ranking official in al qaeda writ large , and the obama administration views it as the most dangerous component of al qaeda 's global network . so it is interesting that , in the months before the yemeni government was overthrown by iran-backed rebels , president obama described the u.s.-yemen counterterrorism partnership as a shining example of success in the fight against al qaeda -- interesting because the president did not do more to help that `` partner '' government remain in power . once again , the president and his advisers appear to have either ignored or failed to recognize the trajectory of events in the middle east . what were they thinking ? and how do they plan to combat aqap now ? despite what the white house wants the world to believe , a sober look at the security environment reveals the following key realities : . isis controls a large amount of territory in the middle east , and the group is rapidly growing its ranks in places such as libya and afghanistan , while at the same time inspiring and plotting attacks in the west . and , although isis is trying to `` out al qaeda '' al qaeda , resorting to attention winning stunts to boost its profile on television sets around the world , al qaeda itself is no less of a threat to the united states and our allies today than it was in january 2014 . at the same time , the routine failures of president obama and his advisers to understand the security environment , and to appropriately tailor america 's national security posture in a manner demanded by it , foretells more disasters lie ahead . not only americans , but also our allies should be very , very afraid . indeed , president obama 's refusal to simply call a problem like radical islam by its name strongly suggests he is unwilling to make the difficult decisions that must be made today if we are to stand a chance of defeating radical islamist groups . history has shown the dangers that millions can be placed in if our leaders do n't face down a looming threat by calling it what it is and putting our full weight behind efforts to vanquish it . president obama has the resources at his disposal to do just that . but if he wants to help define a future for the middle east and north africa in which fewer threats emanate from those regions , he must spend more time listening to talented professionals in our military and intelligence community versus the idealists and yes-men surrounding him at the white house . there is too much at stake in the near term to continue down the path of experimentation with pollyannaish theories about how to attain this future that have actually rendered us less safe . indeed , president obama should also pay closer attention to what representatives from arab states are saying behind closed doors . most of their bosses would love to be the claimants to the prize of defeating isis and al qaeda . however , all of them recognize that , unless we all want things to get a whole lot worse before they might get any better , the united states will have to deploy considerably more of our `` kinetic '' resources to put those victories in sight . this does not mean a ground forces-intensive response is required from us at this time . but if the president thinks it prudent to wait on our arab partners to do most of the heavy lifting , he could be guaranteeing this will be the case in the not-too-distant future .\\xb0\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xdc)kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- kathmandu is a city with few good stories right now , but tanka maya sitoula has one of them . the 40-year-old mother-of-four was at home when saturday 's deadly 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck , bringing the 5-story building down around her ground floor apartment . in the wake of the disaster , which has left at least 4,500 people dead across nepal , sitoula endured 36 long hours trapped in a room on the ground floor , before she was freed by an indian rescue team . remarkably , she escaped without injury , apparently protected by a beam . sitoula , who talked to cnn through an interpreter , says she remained confident she would survive throughout her ordeal amid the rubble . `` i heard people making noise outside so i thought i would be rescued , '' she said , as she and her family sheltered in the grounds of a nearby school . `` i was confident that everybody was there outside and that i would be rescued . '' what did she do for 36 hours ? `` i was just lying down , '' she says . `` there was no room to move here and there . '' sitoula 's husband mahendra , a butcher , said he called out for help for hours after the quake , as he could hear her shouting in the rubble of the collapsed building . `` i was totally confident that she was there , '' he said . `` i never stopped calling her . and also from down below she was making sounds and i could hear her . '' it took 18 hours before the necessary help arrived , he said . and it took another 18 hours to free her . `` i was asking people for help . traffic police , whoever i could find . what happened was there were no tools to cut through the metal debris . '' eventually , a rescue team from india had the equipment required , he said . throughout the ordeal , he never gave up hope , he says : `` i was confident that my wife was safe and sound . '' he was only concerned about how she would fare during the attempt to free her . inspector karam singh from india 's national disaster management authority was supervising search and rescue efforts at the sitoulas ' former home tuesday -- a bright pink building , pancaked into two levels , with an entire wall sheared off to reveal its purple interior . he described the rescue efforts as physically draining work -- `` cutting , pushing and pulling '' -- but extremely rewarding in the case of sitoula . `` she was happy , so so happy . she was n't stopping praising us , '' he said . `` we said it 's good to have a -lsb- survivor -rsb- . '' singh said workers had recovered one body from the building , adding that he believed eight to 10 others remained trapped inside . but as a french team of sniffer dogs completed a sweep of the ruins with no promising signs , following a search with a sensor earlier which also showed no signs of life , singh said there was `` no chance '' of finding any survivors . as a digger worked to clear the rubble of her former home , sitoula agreed : two days after her rescue , she says it is highly unlikely there are others as lucky as her , still surviving beneath the rubble . the prognosis is equally dire in kathmandu 's gangabhu neighborhood , where search teams are focusing their efforts on a cluster of collapsed six-story guesthouses . a handler from a japanese search dog team climbs down the wreckage with a stern expression . `` i 'm sorry . it did n't work out , '' he tells the nepalese police officers involved in the search and recovery effort . officer tejush swarnakar , with the nepalese armed police , says officials believe about 50 people may be trapped in the rubble . four bodies have been recovered -- but on monday , there was a rare survival story . members of gea , a turkish volunteer search and rescue team , pulled 21-year-old john keisi from the debris after a 13-hour rescue effort . swarnakar 's colleagues were also diverted into action nearby , when dozens of protesters block a busy thoroughfare , chanting : `` down with the government . '' there are complaints , specifically , that the government is not doing enough to prevent rising transport prices in the wake of the earthquake . a bus window is smashed and there are brief scuffles as police move in to clear the crowd using shields and long batons . a short walk away , along the banks of the bishnumati river , residents perch precariously on the slanted roof of a collapsed building in an attempt to salvage what they can . next door , a striking sight : a rope of knotted sheets hangs from a third-floor window . neighbor aakash karki , 19 , says that seven people escaped using the rope . as the sun starts to set , crowds gather in kathmandu 's sitapali neighborhood to watch the work of a large group of rescue and recovery teams . this is where members of gea made the first of their two rescues in nepal at 3 a.m. sunday , pulling bikram chepang , 22 , from the debris of 11 collapsed buildings . now , back at the site , there are faint hopes that a third , and remarkable , rescue may on the cards . a search dogs scouring the wreckage has given an indication that it may have detected life . the volunteers continue their search , but conclude the dog was mistaken . they do n't believe there 's anyone alive inside . read more : nepal earthquake - how you can helpread more : shattered lives - houses and families ripped apart .\\xf8\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x9f0-lrb- cnn -rrb- sunday 's announcement that corinthian colleges inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable . corinthian , which once enrolled more than 70,000 students , is one of the worst of the `` predator colleges '' -- schools that offer dubious degrees , saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year . many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online . it 's no wonder that corinthian is doing this after the u.s. department of education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer . there are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges , many of which have questionable track records , and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools . with uncle sam 's student loan debt sheet topping $ 1 trillion , we literally ca n't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86 % of their funding from federal student loan money . for those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco , here 's the whole story in one telling statistic : while for-profit colleges enroll only 13 % of the nation 's college students , such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults , according to department of education statistics . for comparison 's sake , the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis . how do these colleges operate ? it 's deviously simple : convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans , keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors , and watch the money roll in . the aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind . recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day , according to a propublica investigation . i can personally attest to the aggressive tactics . my phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently , and i received so many calls per day that i had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number . stopping the exploitation of students is n't easy . the for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry . the ceos of these companies make millions of dollars a year , employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties . but the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis . hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct corinthian joined a `` debt strike , '' publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans . in response , education department secretary arne duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects . now that corinthian is finally shutting down , we must finish the job . the remaining for-profit colleges should be closed . any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim , and their debts should be forgiven . yes , `` victim '' is the right word . if these degrees actually helped people get jobs , we should be celebrating them . but according to a jaw-dropping report by the education department , the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout . not the equivalent of a high school dropout . less than a high school dropout . the real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about . one corinthian graduate has $ 37,000 in debt for his computer science degree , but he ca n't even get a job at best buy , according to slate . another graduate , $ 33,000 in debt , has a medical assisting degree , but she gave up on finding employment in her field . she waits tables now , the chronicle of higher education says . i can already hear your next question . if for-profit colleges are this terrible , are they at least cheaper ? no . in fact , their cost is reportedly around 60 % higher than a comparable degree from a public college . what 's even more frustrating is that we 've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years . a 2011 report by the government accountability office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating . in one example , an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor , `` it 's not hard to get a 100 % on the second try ; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again , '' according to the new york times . in 2013 , career education corp. paid $ 10 million to settle charges by the state of new york regarding phony job-placement claims . all told , no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014 . after selling off 95 of its campuses last year , corinthian said on sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses , blaming the failure on `` federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions '' on potential buyers . you ca n't hide your bad behavior forever , and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them . enrollment at the university of phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the united states -- has fallen by half , to about 213,000 . we laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis , and it 's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges . to keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now . for-profit colleges have flunked their final exam . now it 's up to their rich benefactor , uncle sam , to make sure they do n't go back to school in the fall . editor 's note : an earlier version of this article said the san diego campus of the university of phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year ; that issue has been resolved .\\x8c\\x12\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb1(-lrb- cnn -rrb- the hillary clinton presidential campaign surely anticipated the coming wave of inquiries and criticism about conflicts of interest involving big foreign donors to charities run by the clinton family -- questions set to get a thorough airing in a new book called `` clinton cash : the untold story of how and why foreign governments and businesses helped make bill and hillary rich '' by peter schweizer , coming out may 5 . my guess is that the issues raised by the book will prompt team clinton to put its candidate on the road , where she can continue holding loosely scheduled , informal meetings with ordinary americans -- the sorts of people more concerned about local jobs than whether some foreign government or company paid a big speaking fee to bill clinton in hopes of getting special treatment by secretary of state hillary clinton . it 's not that the alleged conflicts are n't potentially serious ; as i recently noted in these pages , they are . according to the wall street journal , in 2014 the clinton foundation `` received money from the united arab emirates , saudi arabia and oman , among others . the donors included canada 's foreign affairs department , which is promoting the keystone xl pipeline . '' that 's the same keystone xl pipeline from canada that the state department all but endorsed , concluding after a five-part analysis that ran to 17,000 pages that the project 's environmental impact would be minimal . president obama vetoed a bill that would have allowed the pipeline to be built , but it 's legitimate to ask whether the donation from canada directly or indirectly influenced the state department 's analysis . and several news outlets have reported that banks and other companies with business before the u.s. government were donors to the clinton global initiative , a sister group that was spun off from the clinton foundation . cnn 's alexandra jaffe wrote last month that `` listings for the clinton global initiative 's annual meeting found partnerships with at least six banks that were under investigation , involved in litigation or had been fined by government agencies and regulators at the time of the meeting . in every case , the bank in question was listed as a sponsor of the event even after the investigations were widely reported in the media . '' those are serious matters -- but so are stubborn unemployment , troubled schools , high taxes and other problems that top the list of voters ' concerns . a bank giving money to charity in hopes of buying leniency from the government is a cause for concern , but until and unless a smoking gun appears in the form of a clear exchange of money for favors , it becomes hard to say what , exactly , is wrong with donating cash to aid in a good cause like combating world hunger or helping to rebuild haiti . even among the banks fined for wrongdoing that contributed to clinton charities , noted jaffe , `` there 's no indication the clintons had any knowledge of the ongoing investigations into banks supporting the foundation 's efforts . '' that does n't leave much room for outrage . a more serious critique of the clinton foundations is that they have been an administrative and financial quagmire from their origins , running deficits , expanding uncontrollably and cutting deals that not only raise ethical questions but cast the family 's management skill in a less-than-flattering light . in a well-known case of deception , a con man named raffaello follieri charmed his way into the foundation 's good graces , earning public praise from bill clinton for promising $ 50 million to the clinton global initiative -- money that never materialized . a more serious problem developed internally , with staff members fighting over the direction and management of the charities . in 2007 and 2008 , the foundation ran a $ 40 million deficit and in 2012 had an $ 8 million deficit . so we already knew that the clintons ' charities suffered from poor management and took money from companies and governments that were clearly trying to curry favor . it 's distasteful , but by now it 's not news . unless the forthcoming book unveils some blockbuster new information , questions about the clintons ' charities is likely to wind up on the same political shelf on which voters seem to have parked concerns about hillary clinton 's use of private emails to conduct state department business . according to a recent poll by the rightward-leaning rasmussen -- taken after the email issue was splashed all over the news -- a survey of voters likely to vote in 2016 found that 57 % expect clinton to win the presidency . no wonder clinton seemed positively unconcerned about the forthcoming book . `` we 're back into the political scene , and therefore we will be subjected to all kinds of distractions and i 'm ready for it , '' she said in new hampshire . calling extensive exposure of conflicts of interest `` distractions '' suggests that clinton knows what the polls suggest : that in a nation still struggling to emerge from a long recession , voters will likely judge her on something other than the efficiency and ethics of her charities .O\\x15\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbf(miami -lrb- cnn -rrb- inside a plane at miami international airport , baggage handlers are going on a shopping spree with passengers ' bags . what they do n't know is that they are being recorded on a hidden camera . the miami-dade police department set up the camera as part of an ongoing police investigation into luggage thefts by the very airport workers who are supposed to get bags safely onto planes . email your story ideas and tips to cnntips@cnn.com . `` it 's a problem we all face , '' said police lt. pete estis . `` we will continue to be proactive until we can see that the claims of pilfering through luggage will actually decrease . '' miami aviation director emilio t. gonz\\xc3\\xa1lez said the insider theft cases `` are indeed the exception among the thousands of decent , hardworking employees at mia , and they have been prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law for their crimes . '' and these insider thefts just do n't happen in miami . a cnn analysis of passenger property loss claims filed with the tsa from 2010 to 2014 shows 30,621 claims of missing valuables , mostly packed in checked luggage . the rest occurred at security checkpoints . total property loss claimed : $ 2.5 million . john f. kennedy international airport in new york topped the list of airports with the most claims of thefts from luggage , followed by los angeles international , orlando international and miami international , according to the data . the problem has been so serious at jfk that in 2013 , el al airlines set up a hidden camera in a baggage hold . the camera showed baggage handlers stealing items on flights bound for israel , including a $ 5,000 seiko watch , iphones , an ipad , cameras , gold rings and cash . six of those arrested pleaded guilty to possession of stolen property or petty larceny and the seventh suspect 's case was sealed , according to the queens district attorney 's office . the high-profile case , though , did n't stop the thefts . two more baggage handlers at jfk were arrested in 2014 after authorities said they stole two designer handbags from a suitcase , and then tried to sell them on ebay . then , in december , seven more jfk baggage handlers were charged with stealing valuables from checked luggage . the items were stolen from suitcases of passengers traveling to or from hawaii , japan , johannesburg , london , bangkok , dubai , milan and various u.s. cities . in miami , which aggressively goes after luggage thieves , police have arrested 31 baggage handlers and ramp workers since 2012 , including six so far this year . police set up a hidden camera inside the belly of a plane last year and caught baggage handlers rifling through luggage and stealing various items . another hidden camera caught a baggage handler rummaging through bags in a secure luggage room inside the airport while a security guard looked the other way . `` insider threat is very scary for us in law enforcement , and certainly someone taking somebody 's cell phone , ipad , computer -- what 's next ? '' estis said . a cnn investigation earlier this year found that miami and orlando are the only two major airports in the country that require employees to be screened through metal detectors . miami even checks employees when they leave work to go into the main terminal . but that apparently has n't stopped the luggage thieves . `` as far as being able to get the property off the airfield , that 's a great question , '' estis said . `` we have theories . '' in los angeles , police last year executed search warrants on 25 locations after getting complaints about thefts in two terminals . among the valuables found were computers , watches , jewelry and cameras and designer bags . sixteen airport workers were fired . `` we cut theft in those two terminals by 60 % because of doing that aggressive investigative work , '' said patrick gannon , police chief of los angeles international airport . luggage theft could definitely lead to more serious problems , he said . `` i absolutely think that if we do n't pay attention to the small things that happen around here , that it could lead to much larger things . so there is , i believe , a connection between baggage theft and terrorism , '' gannon said . even the tsa has had problem employees . since 2002 , the agency has fired 513 officers for theft . it employs about 50,000 officers today , and last year screened more than 443 million checked bags and nearly 1.7 billion carry-ons . da : guns smuggled on planes by delta employee ` egregious ' security breach . luggage theft is n't confined to airport workers . outsiders have been caught on surveillance cameras stealing luggage from carousels . cnn contacted airports around the country and found while the total thefts from carousels are relatively low , it continues to be a problem . for example , seattle reported 214 luggage thefts from carousels and other airport locations last year , 200 in las vegas , 36 in atlanta , 35 in phoenix , 15 at ronald reagan washington national , 14 at dulles international and 10 at chicago 's o'hare airport . odd tsa finds . cnn 's harmeet kaur and yasmin khorram contributed to this report .\\x8c\\n\"\n",

'' the visit was highly anticipated because it would have marked kim 's first official foreign trip since inheriting the leadership of north korea in late 2011 . he was to have met with russian president vladimir putin as part of the may visit to coincide with victory day , marking the 70th anniversary of the soviet union 's victory over nazi germany in world war ii . kim also could have had the chance to rub elbows with the heads of about 30 other governments , including the leaders of china , cuba , india , germany , vietnam and venezuela . this number represents about half the world leaders that russia has said it invited to the celebrations . kim 's trip had been anticipated since late december , when russian state media reported that moscow had extended an invitation . there was no further explanation , from moscow or pyongyang , as to why he would n't head west . still , north korea has a number of issues it 's been wrestling with for years . they include widespread poverty , its longstanding spat with neighboring south korea and the united states , as well as its international isolation largely due to its controversial nuclear program . and news about kim 's non-visit comes a day after south korean intelligence agents told lawmakers that kim is ruling with an iron fist , having ordered the execution of about 15 senior officials so far this year . cnn can not independently confirm the executions detailed by shin kyung-min , a lawmaker with the new politics alliance for democracy who attended the closed briefing . and the nature of the intelligence supporting the allegations was not immediately clear . that said , north korea is one of the most closed societies in the world . and there 's little doubt that kim is very much in charge . according to shin , intelligence officials say the north korean leader is ruling in an impromptu manner and does not countenance excuses or any views that vary with his own . cnn 's madison park and alla eshchenko contributed to this report . cnn 's matthew chance reported from moscow , and cnn 's ed payne and greg botelho wrote this story from atlanta .,\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xb6 shanghai , china -lrb- cnn -rrb- with a well-paid job in finance and his own apartment , li lifei is living the chinese dream . but there 's one missing ingredient -- his own car . the 26-year old has his eye on a volkswagen tiguan but shanghai , like many large chinese cities , rations license plates as it looks for a solution to its gridlocked roads and polluted skies . to register for a license plate auction , prospective car buyers like li must put down a deposit in exchange for disc containing software they can use to bid online . the auctions take place once a month on a saturday morning . `` i 've been trying for six months with no success , '' li told cnn . to boost his chances , li upgraded the speed of his internet connection from 10 to 50 mbps but to no avail . each month there are around 10,000 license plates available . at the most recent auction on saturday , li said the final price was 80,600 yuan -lrb- $ 13,000 -rrb- -- around three times the price of a cheap chinese car and a third of what li plans to spend on his suv . it 's possible to get a temporary license , but that has to be renewed every month , and li says he does n't want to use a huangniu , or middleman , some of whom employ hundreds of bidders to obtain the coveted registration . `` i know people who 've been trying for more than a year , '' he said . another option would be to buy a hybrid vehicle that automatically qualifies for a license plate -- a selling point not lost on the car manufacturers showing their latest models and concepts at the shanghai auto show this week . toyota , volkswagen and volvo all launched gasoline-electric hybrids for the chinese market at the show , while chinese manufacturer byd has been an early pioneer of electric and hybrid cars . `` the infrastructure -lrb- charging stations -rrb- for electric vehicles is not quite there yet but that 's the advantage of a hybrid -- you can have both , '' said volvo ceo hakan samuelsson . but chinese drivers have n't wholeheartedly embraced the concept . even though china overtook the united states as the world 's largest car market in 2009 , sales of electric and hybrid vehicles , while increasing quickly , still lag behind the u.s. , where more than 100,000 were sold last year . and it 's thought many are sold to local authorities and state industries , which are responding to central government directives . few chinese have american-style garages where the vehicles can be charged overnight . li said he thought it would be inconvenient . `` i do n't want a hybrid car . i thought maybe a tesla but it 's too expensive , '' he said , referring to the hyper luxury electric sports car developed by elon musk that has seen weak sales in china . for others , the hassles of buying and owning a car have become too much and some affluent city dwellers are spurning cars . shanghai resident lei gu , 35 , learned to drive as a student and microsoft employee in seattle and loved driving her compact geo on the open u.s. roads . but when she returned to china nine years ago , she chose not to purchase a car . `` i used to love driving but i do n't think i could drive here even if i wanted to . `` even though we have traffic rules , people do n't follow them . i can barely cross the street . '' she 's also put off by the congested traffic and the high cost of parking . if shanghai 's extensive subway system does n't take her where she wants to go , she uses a popular uber-like taxi app -- or rents a car . she 's not alone . a recent report by consultants bain & company suggested that even though china 's love affair with the car began late , it may already be souring . of 2,137 people it surveyed , some 40 % said cars were losing their appeal as a status symbol . gu says luxury cars like bmws and mercedes are still an important way to `` show face '' among many of her friends . `` if you 've been working for 10 years and do n't have a car , people might wonder if you have financial problems , '' she said . but she prefers to spend her money on other things like traveling abroad . `` i do care about face but there are other ways to show it .

      "b\"\\x8a\\x1d-lrb- cnn -rrb- chile 's calbuco volcano erupted again thursday , marking the third time since last week , the national service of geology and mining said . gregorio billikopf lives across lake llanquihue from the volcano has been photographing and videotaping the three eruptions and described thursday 's event as spectacular but not as severe as the two prior ones . `` there is still smoke on and off , but nothing so dramatic -lrb- as before -rrb- , '' said billikopf , a retired university adviser on agricultural issues . `` on a good day i can see about eight volcanoes . `` i understand that the rain that was announced for today would have been a disaster , '' he added . he lives in a rainy part of chile , which he described as like a garden of eden . the explosion produced an extensive plume , but it was also described as smaller than the eruptions on april 22 and april 23 , according to cnn chile . deputy interior minister mahmud aleuy said about 1,500 people were evacuated , and security measures will continue as `` contingency plans are operating , '' cnn chile reported thursday . for the past several days , the geology agency has maintained there was a possibility of a third eruption as part of steadily declining seismic activity in the area . a 20-kilometer -lrb- 12-mile -rrb- exclusion zone has been established around the crater , and chilean authorities have been keeping residents away from that zone . last week , military and police forces helped evacuate more than 4,400 residents , the interior ministry said then . the seismic event is sure to add to the volume of ash already spewed since the first eruption . ash spread to argentina in the second eruption , which occurred a day after the first . evacuations in the region involved not only people but also animals . the volcanic debris has landed and piled up in some places to a depth of almost 2 feet , the ministry of interior and public safety said . new advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet . there was no immediate information on the strength of the third eruption , but government officials have said the second , spectacular nighttime eruption was stronger than the first one . last week in ensenada , houses , trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash . people were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- because of fears of contamination from ash and lava . trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets . authorities last week issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of puerto montt and puerto varas in southern chile . last week , people were being evacuated to puerto montt on 22 buses and military trucks , the interior ministry said . officials said that volcanic flows from calbuco caused rising water levels in the r\\xc3\\xado blanco . the first eruption set off a bit of a panic in the region . `` at the beginning , it was small , and later , the cloud grew . and later , there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts , '' a puerto montt resident said . another person said : `` it was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud , with the immense force of the volcano , and to see the ashes . at that point , there was a lot of panic , lots of chaos , traffic jams , people going to supermarkets , everyone looking for water , trying to take out money from the atms . '' magma expanse under yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought . the eruption is a first for many in the region . the last major eruption was in 1962 . there was a minor eruption in 1972 . calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996 . cnn 's shasta darlington contributed from sao paolo , brazil . cnn 's michael pearson also contributed to this report .\\xd6\\x07\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xc4#-lrb- cnn -rrb- for the fifth year in a row in 2014 , ambush attacks on police officers were the no. 1 cause of felonious deaths of law enforcement officers in the line of duty . nevertheless , google continues to market a smartphone application that lets lawbreakers pinpoint the location of police officers in the field . google 's executives wo n't even discuss the subject with organizations representing law enforcement . google 's popular real-time traffic app , waze , uses gps navigation and crowdsourcing to alert users to traffic jams , automobile accidents , stalled cars , and through its `` traffic cop '' feature , the presence of law enforcement . most people undoubtedly use waze 's police-finding feature to avoid traffic tickets , but the app poses an enormous risk to deputies and police officers . in the days before he assassinated new york police officers rafael ramos and wenjian liu at point blank range while they sat in their patrol car last december , ismaaiyl brinsley is known to have used the waze application to monitor the movements of police officers . the killer identified the location of police on his own waze account and even posted screen captures to instagram . while google -lrb- which acquired waze in 2013 for a reported $ 1.1 billion -rrb- claims the app `` is all about contributing to the ` common good ' out there on the road , '' the risks far outweigh the potential benefits . every day , thousands of police officers and deputies enforce traffic laws , execute arrest and search warrants , investigate domestic violence complaints and perform countless tasks that are needed to keep our neighborhoods safe and remove criminals from the streets . it takes just a couple of clicks on waze 's `` traffic cop '' icon to identify their locations and indicate whether -- in the opinion of the anonymous user -- the officer is `` visible '' or `` invisible . '' at that moment , the officer or deputy becomes an identifiable target whose whereabouts are available to any one of waze 's 50 million users worldwide . social media has made enormous contributions to law enforcement as a `` force multiplier '' that lets citizens help police protect our communities . as we have seen with the emergence of crimes like identity theft , however , technology has the potential for evil as well as good . in the case of waze , we are confronted with a tool that can be lethal to police officers and deputies , whose roles in society are to protect our citizens and enforce the laws that keep our communities safe . google , whose stated mission is `` to organize the world 's information and make it universally accessible and useful , '' is now marketing an app with the potential to obstruct law enforcement and put the lives of police officers and deputies at risk . even the more benign uses of waze 's `` traffic cop '' feature are concerning . in 2013 , 10,076 people were killed in alcohol-related automobile accidents . and in 2011 , 9,944 people lost their lives in speed-related fatal crashes . is the highest , best use of google 's geo-mapping and crowdsourcing capabilities to help drunk drivers avoid checkpoints and give speeders assistance in evading speed limits ? it 's not just the speeders and drunk drivers who have access to the locations of police officers through google 's technology . perpetrators of domestic violence can use it to find out about the presence of law enforcement in a spouse 's neighborhood ; gang members , narcotics dealers , even those intent on perpetrating an act of terror , all have access to waze 's `` traffic cop '' feature . google has built a solid reputation as a good corporate neighbor , tying for first place in a 2013 study by the reputation institute measuring companies ' reputations for corporate social responsibility . the company makes much of its compliance with legal , moral and ethical obligations as a good corporate neighbor . but when it comes to waze , google has gone into a defensive crouch . the company 's executives flat out refused to discuss the subject with representatives of the national sheriffs ' association , an organization representing more than 3,000 sheriff 's offices across the united states . the refusal of google 's executives to even dignify our concerns by meeting with us offends our conscience . if google 's real objective is the `` common good out there on the road , '' it will work with us to ensure the safety of both motorists and police officers . the goals are not mutually exclusive : we can have both .\\x1f\\r\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' sledge never saw a dime of songwriting royalties . he had some regrets about that , he told blues and soul magazine -- the song would have helped provide for his children -- but he accepted it . `` worst decision i ever made . but i am not at all bitter . i figure if god wanted me to do what i did , and say what i did to tell those guys they could have the song , then i 'll leave it that away , '' he told the magazine . `` when a man loves a woman '' became a standard , covered many times -- michael bolton took it to no. 1 in 1991 -- and featured on several movie soundtracks . it was even the title of a 1994 film starring andy garcia and meg ryan . sledge 's version also returned to the charts , hitting the uk top 10 in 1987 . even with his other hits , he said , it all came back to `` when a man loves a woman . '' `` the granddaddy to all of my songs . the boss of all of my songs . i have great respect for that song , '' he told blues and soul . `` always will . '' sledge was inducted into the rock hall in 2005 . his death was followed two weeks later by that of another '60s soul legend , ben e. king , who had an enduring hit in 1961 with `` stand by me .

      "b\"\\xa89-lrb- cnn -rrb- the powers of marvel 's all-star superheroes go a bit wobbly in `` avengers : age of ultron . '' faced with the daunting prospect of topping the surprise and excitement of 2012 's the avengers , the third highest-grossing film of all time , writer-director joss whedon mixes some brooding down-time in with the abundant spectacle . to be sure , series junkies will get their fix from the sheer massiveness of the exploits , but at least two of the big action scenes are lackluster , while the climax and resolution could have been worked out in more complex , less rote ways , so as to further increase intrigue and anticipation for `` avengers : infinity war parts 1 and 2 , '' already scheduled for release in may of 2018 and 2019 , respectively . not that any of this will matter much , since the pent-up excitement among the enormous international fan base is so intense that nothing will keep the summer 's presumed biggest franchise blockbuster from soaring to and beyond the one-billion dollar threshold internationally . hands-on producer kevin feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in hollywood history , a veritable solar system of staggeringly profitable individual franchises unified by the overpowering collective force of the avengers . so while sideline enterprises like the new `` daredevil '' tv series continue to pop up , the company can be so confident in the enduring appeal of its theatrical mainstays that it recently published a release schedule for its remaining big-gun commercial titles from now through the end of the decade . at this point , no one would be willing to bet on when a sense of terminal deja vu might set in to bring it all to an end , and comic-con can plan its main events years ahead . in the meantime , the key points of interest surround how many surprises and twists can be wrung from a format and set of expectations that demand great fealty from core fans ; any significant deviations are taken as personal betrayals by the hardest-core geeks . last summer , `` guardians of the galaxy '' showed that marvel could play it a bit more fast and loose than it generally does , but the big-name franchises still seem sacrosanct . and so it is with `` avengers : age of ultron , '' which at moments takes a peek down some shadowy side roads but ends up mostly zooming along the main highway to deliver what the audience wants rather than something even a little bit different . picking up where last year 's `` captain america : winter soldier '' left off , the new film , without preamble , dives right in to show the avengers dispatching the remnants of the nasty hydra organization in a hectically and indifferently staged forest combat scene that leaves clint barton/hawkeye -lrb- jeremy renner -rrb- worse for wear while also introducing two new adversaries , twins pietro and wanda -lrb- aaron-taylor johnson and elizabeth olsen -rrb- . victory allows for some passably amusing scenes of the heroes blowing off steam : the favorite party trick of thor -lrb- chris hemsworth -rrb- is to challenge all comers to lift up his hammer ; natasha/black widow -lrb- scarlett johansson -rrb- and bruce banner/the hulk -lrb- mark ruffalo -rrb- pursue a little mating dance in which her amorous interest is predicated upon his retaining his human rather than superhero form ; and tony stark/iron man -lrb- robert downey jr. -rrb- and steve rogers/captain america -lrb- chris evans -rrb- take stock of the advances their old nazi nemesis strucker -lrb- thomas kretschmann -rrb- appears to be making in the artificial intelligence department , specifically with the most sophisticated humanoid ever devised , ultron -lrb- voiced with marvelous robotic nuance by james spader -rrb- . what 's behind warner bros. ' risky move to release nine movies . ultron is a cool and sophisticated creation ; what he lacks , of course , is a heart , which is what makes him such an imposing villain . a sleekly designed robot you might even call handsome , he makes an excellent intellectual and smart-ass sparring partner for stark , but when he first appears , he 's still on training wheels . however , he does recruit pietro and wanda to his cause , an easy matter since stark killed their parents . he 's not yet entirely ready to conquer the universe but , in their first skirmish with him , the avengers are sufficiently outclassed to begin worrying . could ` star wars ' open at $ 500 million ? licking their wounds at the `` safe house '' of hawkeye 's farm , the avengers go into a funk . the impatient thor quickly takes off `` to find answers , '' bruce resists natasha 's desire to get something physical cooking between them ; stark , lamenting that `` ultron is tryng to tear us apart , '' consults with old cohort nick fury -lrb- samuel l. jackson , briefly -rrb- , while mad men 's linda cardellini , playing hawkeye 's stand-by-your-man wife , is stuck with the -lrb- intentionally ? -rrb- funniest line of dialogue in the film : `` you know i totally support your avenging . '' while some of his partners wallow in disarray , captain america heads for seoul , where the next evolutionary step is to emerge via a device called `` the cradle , '' which will hatch mass-produced android soldiers that will pave the way for ultron 's world domination . but a major chase through the city involving a runaway subway train falls flat due to basic conceptual silliness and poor action continuity . of course , the avengers ultimately get it together to do the kind of butt-kicking they 're supposed to do , and a very welcome addition to the team comes in the form of the android called vision . red-faced and green-garbed , vision is given a striking profile and overall presence by paul bettany -lrb- heretofore limited in the marvel world to vocal work as stark 's computerized butler j.a.r.v.i.s. -rrb- , and it can be hoped , if not assumed , that this most intriguing character will play an even more important role in the final two avengers installments . ` galaxy quest ' tv series in the works . ultimately , whedon 's efforts to invest the heroes with a degree of uncertainty and vulnerability comes off as half-baked , as such an effort can only go so far due to the nature of the material . after all , these are comic book characters defined by their double identities ; a third dimension is neither required nor perhaps even desired . if ending on a dramatic cliffhanger note had been desired , the elements were there for the taking ; including a semi-tragic component along with mystery about ultron 's ultimate fate would arguably have only further cranked up anticipation for the coming chapters . but , then , what does that matter when the automatic attendance of millions is assured ? `` avengers : age of ultron '' succeeds in the top priority of creating a worthy opponent for its superheroes and giving the latter a few new things to do , but this time the action scenes do n't always measure up and some of the characters are left in a kind of dramatic no-man 's - land . the returning series actors acquit themselves in the expected agreeable manner , while series newcomer andy serkis has a terrific couple of minutes as a tough but stressed south african criminal . \\xc2\\xa9 2015 the hollywood reporter . all rights reserved .\\xe0\\x0c\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' chris nashawaty , entertainment weekly : `` no one forks over 10 bucks to see one of these flicks for its logic . we go for the bananas demolition-derby mayhem . ` furious 7 ' delivers that with the direct visceral rush of an epipen . for two hours and change , we 're treated to a high-octane orgy of some of the most exhilarating stunts ever put on film , including one showstopper where walker balances on an overturned bus that 's teetering on the edge of a cliff . '' chris ziegler , the verge : `` it 's entirely possible , of course , that my fandom has simply blinded me to ` furious 7 's ' greatness . the action sequences -- particularly abu dhabi , with the supercar leaping between buildings -- are legitimately phenomenal , and the scenes filmed after walker 's passing , in which his brothers stepped in for him , were never distracting or even noticeable without looking closely . maybe i 'm missing something . '' a.o. scott , new york times : `` the final moments , when mr. walker 's longtime colleagues say their farewells while he still appears to be on screen with them , are both awkward and moving . they remind you what these movies have always been about , underneath all the noise and the bravado : the ferocity of friendship and the terrible speed of loss . '' betsy sharkey , los angeles times : `` the action sequences -- from hand-to-hand combat to the crash and burn of cars -- are , as we 've come to expect , not grounded in reality . the parkour-influenced high-rise stunts that everyone will be talking about are particularly affecting because a -rrb- they feature the multimillion-dollar eye-candy of a jewel-encrusted limited-edition lykan hypersport and b -rrb- they are amazing . all of the driving and skydiving fall into the never-try-this-at-home zone . '' richard lawson , vanity fair : `` the latest film , which opens friday , ca n't help but take on some deeper meaning , as the death of main cast member paul walker , killed in a car accident in late 2013 , looms large throughout . but it does n't overwhelm -- furious 7 is respectful , even solemn , when it needs to be , but is still , thank god , plenty of crazy fun .

'' at the bottom of the list was jetblue , which offered the lowest percentage of award seats and the fewest number of award tickets of the five biggest u.s. airlines : 892,000 one-way passenger tickets , or 4.5 % of its total 19.7 million u.s. seats . -lrb- jetblue only operates in 10 of the top 25 markets included in the study . -rrb- . many jetblue customers fly the airline only once or twice per year , making it hard to accumulate miles , an airline spokesman told the magazine . by not allowing miles to expire anymore , the airline says customers will be able to eventually redeem them . delta air lines came in second place with 5.6 million u.s. award seats ; united airlines ranked third with 5 million u.s. award tickets ; and american airlines was fourth with 3.5 million u.s. award seats . what are the world 's safest airlines ? remember that award tickets are n't actually free . the cost of miles is built into everything you buy that 's earning you miles , and the airlines profit from you not using your miles at all . so it behooves consumers to book award travel carefully . on average , nearly 10 % of passengers on the five airlines analyzed by consumer reports flew on domestic award tickets , but some of them were n't getting the best value for their miles . while many u.s. fliers redeemed miles on american airlines flights from los angeles to san francisco , the cheapest average fare on that route was just over $ 100 -- not worth the 12,500 to 30,000 miles needed for an award ticket , consumer reports says . better to use them on american airlines ' route between new york and san francisco or delta 's route between chicago and los angeles , which are generally more expensive than that los angeles-san francisco route , according to consumer reports ' calculations . while award-seat availability is important , it may not matter as much as passengers ' overall satisfaction with an airline . southwest had the highest customer satisfaction score -lrb- 86 -rrb- , followed by jetblue -lrb- 85 -rrb- , delta -lrb- 70 -rrb- , american -lrb- 66 -rrb- and united -lrb- 63 -rrb- . and do n't forget the fees . southwest does n't charge any fees , while other airlines tack on fees for checking bags , booking by phone , changing plans and more .x\\x16\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xa5*-lrb- cnn -rrb- job one for newly appointed attorney general loretta lynch is to create a muscular federal response to months of national unrest over controversial police killings like that of freddie gray , 25 . gray 's death last week -- from a spinal cord injury he suffered while in police custody -- has touched off days of protests and rioting in baltimore . lynch 's job wo n't be easy : as the nation 's top law enforcement officer , she takes the reins of a justice department that has been walking a fine line between nudging local police departments in the direction of better community relations , and threatening legal action against departments where discrimination or brutality are out of control . but as events in baltimore demonstrate , too many local departments are n't getting the message . lynch will need to put down the carrots , pick up the stick and make clear that the justice department intends to crack down on police abuse by using one of its most potent weapons : the power to withhold federal funds from local departments . more about that in a moment . the first order of business will be to re-establish order in baltimore , where the national guard has been mobilized and a state of emergency declared . `` in the days ahead , i intend to work with leaders throughout baltimore to ensure that we can protect the security and civil rights of all residents , '' lynch said within hours of being sworn in on monday . `` and i will bring the full resources of the department of justice to bear in protecting those under threat , investigating wrongdoing and securing an end to violence . '' a key part of that vow -- `` investigating wrongdoing '' -- must include a close look at the baltimore police department , which has been the subject of bitter complaints of brutality . according to a major investigation by the baltimore sun published last fall , the city has paid out $ 5.7 million in court judgments or settlements to more than 100 people since 2011 in connection with allegations of brutality and/or violations of civil rights . `` officers have battered dozens of residents who suffered broken bones -- jaws , noses , arms , legs , ankles -- head trauma , organ failure , and even death , coming during questionable arrests . some residents were beaten while handcuffed ; others were thrown to the pavement , '' the sun expose says . `` and in almost every case , prosecutors or judges dismissed the charges against the victims -- if charges were filed at all . '' that kind of behavior helped set the stage for the riots and looting we now see . lynch has already launched a probe of the death of freddie gray , and the justice department is also investigating the recent videotaped police killing of walter scott in north charleston , south carolina , where an officer has been arrested and charged with murder . as attorney general , lynch has several tools with which to guide local law enforcement toward better behavior . a justice department program called community oriented policing services , launched in 2011 , helps local departments implement best practices . the cops program 's effectiveness will surely come under question , since baltimore was one of the eight departments participating in the voluntary program . lynch can also apply the tougher approach of suing local departments and securing court-ordered reforms , a power conferred by the violent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 . the provision was a result of the 1991 videotaped police beating of rodney king by los angeles cops and the riot that ensued when the officers were acquitted . the obama administration has sued local departments 15 times -- more than either the clinton or bush administrations -- and has opened 11 more investigations of departments including those in cleveland , miami , and ferguson , missouri . but even those tough remedies may not be working , according to the marshall project , a nonprofit news organization that focuses on criminal justice issues . `` even where local leaders have embraced washington 's prescriptions , justice department officials have increasingly found themselves returning to grapple a second time with problems they thought they had fixed , '' writes reporter simone weichselbaum , noting that `` recurring problems have emerged in police departments in miami , new orleans and new jersey , all of which had promised to carry out major changes in response to justice department investigations that turned up evidence of discriminatory policing . '' that leaves lynch with a final , even tougher weapon : the power , under title vi of the civil rights act of 1964 , to deny federal law enforcement dollars to departments that engage in discriminatory practices . lynch 's predecessor as attorney general , eric holder , generally refrained from yanking funds , although in 2013 he did deny drug forfeiture money to the sheriff 's office in alamance county , north carolina , claiming the department was unlawfully targeting latinos for traffic stops . the sheriff of alamance county sued the justice department and the case remains unresolved -- but it underscores the fact that lynch has the power to press local departments , legally and financially , to curb local abuses . she should invoke the power where necessary and calm cities like baltimore as the nation heads into what could be a long , hot summer of unrest .\\x01\\t\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\x8b'-lrb- cnn -rrb- the best part of the supreme court oral arguments about marriage equality was when justice ruth bader ginsburg alluded to s&m . ok , she did n't actually mention s&m , but ginsburg talked about how the institution of marriage has already changed from long ago , when it was `` a dominant and a subordinate relationship . '' `` yes , it was marriage between a man and a woman , but the man decided where the couple would be domiciled , '' said ginsburg . `` it was her obligation to follow him . '' mary bonauto , the attorney arguing on behalf of the four same-sex couples who petitioned the supreme court , said in response : `` that 's correct . ... for centuries we had and europe had this coverture system where a woman 's legal identity was absorbed into that of her husband and men and women had different prescribed legal roles . and again , because of equality and changing social circumstances , all of those gender differences in the rights and responsibilities of the married pair have been eliminated . '' once upon a time , wives were the legal property of their husbands and `` marital rape '' was not only not a crime but not even a concept . to argue that the definition of marriage has not changed since then is either willfully ignorant or woefully na\\xc3\\xafve . justice anthony kennedy , widely believed to be the key swing vote amidst a court otherwise generally evenly divided along ideological lines , at one point referred to `` the nobility and the sacredness of marriage . '' which is true , if you ignore the history of its past and the reality of infidelity in the present . if anything , the nobility and sacredness of marriage need protecting from straight people . one downside to arguing that marriage has `` always been '' between a man and a woman is that , therefore , any problems in the institution of marriage are also plainly the responsibility of heterosexual couples , too . the one justice who did n't ask a question is clarence thomas , who , with one slight exception , has now gone over nine years without a single inquiry from the bench . it should be carefully noted here that thomas is a black man married to a white woman . anti-miscegenation laws banning interracial marriage were first introduced in 1661 in maryland . that means that by 1967 , when the supreme court considered the constitutionality of such laws , bans against interracial marriage had been officially part of the american `` definition '' of marriage for over 300 years . just 20 years after the supreme court struck down the anti-miscegenation laws still in effect in 16 states , clarence thomas and his wife , virginia , were married . james braxton peterson , director of africana studies at lehigh university , has written , `` the fact that the thomas ' marriage required progressive supreme court action must in some way inform their sense of this moment . '' or maybe not . clarence thomas did n't say one way or the other , though his remarks outside court and in dissenting opinions suggest he 's firmly opposed to the supreme court doing for other loving relationships what it once did for his own . but perhaps the example of clarence thomas speaks to what seems most glaring about the oral arguments in the marriage equality cases , namely that just as with the rest of america , the supreme court seems to have increasingly become a place for partisan theatrics . perhaps this was always the case , justices hiding their personal beliefs behind legal rationales . still , the marriage equality arguments seemed even more shaped by politics than the law . on the one hand , pulling pages right from republican presidential candidates , conservative chief justice john roberts suggested the court should n't intervene in a state-driven social debate . aping conservative religious activists , justice samuel alito asked whether four people could then get married . on the other hand , justice stephen breyer talked about marriage as a fundamental liberty while justice elena kagan pushed back on whether legalizing same-sex marriage would really harm or take anything away from opposite-sex couples . both arguments , and the moral force beneath them , seemed to echo gay rights messaging . still , the highly political and momentous decision in loving vs. virginia was unanimous . whichever way the court rules on same-sex marriage , it appears unlikely the ruling will be unanimous . so , while the definition of marriage has unarguably evolved , a fact hopefully the supreme court will soon confirm with a ruling in favor of marriage equality , what 's also clear is that the court has evolved . blown by the winds of partisanship whipping up america in general , the supreme court is increasingly divorced from reason and submissive to politics . the question remains not what is fundamentally the right decision -- i think both law and morality are clear in favor of equal treatment . the question is simply which side of the court will dominate the other ./\\x11\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

      "b\"\\xbf -lrb- cnn -rrb- what do walmart , target , and now the koch brothers have in common with the american civil liberties union , colorofchange.org , and the center for american progress ? all of them are adopting or advocating for hiring practices that open up work opportunities for people with convictions and leverage untapped potential in the labor market . koch industries ' recent announcement that it will `` ban the box '' -- i.e. , remove from its job applications the check-box that asks about convictions -- is a big step forward in the movement to break down barriers to employment for job-seekers with records . `` ban the box '' does n't prohibit background checks , it only postpones them until later in the hiring process . it 's one item on a menu of fair-chance hiring reforms intended to ensure that job applicants are evaluated on their skills and qualifications first , rather than judged solely on past mistakes . these policies help reduce recidivism by making employment accessible to job-seekers who need a second chance , and they help break down the stigma of an arrest or conviction record . two generations of the war on drugs , zero tolerance , and aggressive policing have left 70 million adults with arrest or conviction records that undermine their ability to be considered for jobs , even as the job market has grown steadily . millions of people are being left behind , and it 's taking a toll on our economy : the reduced economic output of people with records cost our economy $ 57 - $ 65 billion in 2008 alone . these criminal justice policies disproportionately impact african-americans , who are incarcerated at a rate six times that of whites . the department of justice 's recent investigation of the ferguson police department , for example , shows the extent to which racism is perpetuated through police departments and the court system . that systemic racial disparity is then repeated throughout the economy , and the community is put at a severe disadvantage in the job market long after individuals have served their time . that 's one reason the african-american unemployment rate is persistently twice that of whites . in a job market where employers that did n't previously do background checks now make them a routine part of hiring , qualified job-seekers are being screened out of the applicant pools for more and more jobs . nearly one in three adults in america has an arrest or conviction history that will show up on a routine background check . companies like koch , walmart , target , and bed bath & beyond recognize that this is a huge source of untapped talent , and that 's why they 've already banned the box on their job applications . these policies are also gaining traction with politicians across the political spectrum . vermont gov. peter shumlin , georgia gov. nathan deal , and virginia gov. terry mcauliffe recently signed executive orders removing the conviction question from initial applications for state employment . so far , 16 states and more than 100 cities and counties have adopted fair-chance hiring policies . six of those states and the district of columbia , plus 25 cities and counties , have applied their policies to government contractors or private employers as well . the obama administration took an important step toward fairer and smarter federal hiring practices last year when it issued an executive order prohibiting contractors from discriminating against lgbt individuals . banning the box and other common-sense hiring reforms would build on that progress and on the successful work of governors and the corporate sector . the administration should ensure that the federal government does not continue to erect unfair and unnecessary barriers to employment of people with records . already , more than 200 organizations and prominent individuals have publicly urged the obama administration to take these practical steps . if koch industries -- a major federal contractor -- can ban the box , there 's no reason why other federal contractors can not . now it 's time for president obama to lead the way and embrace fair-chance hiring of people with records .`\\x06\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' as smile attempts to pour tea , the other seven children in this household run around the courtyard . the first wife remains unseen in the house . a portrait of gulnaz 's liberator in 2011 , the then-president hamid karzai , hangs on the wall . but the sense of order here is undermined by the fact that this is a house built around a crime . how gulnaz ended up here requires some explanation . there was pressure upon her to marry her attacker after her release . but at the same time , other activists were trying to assist her with an asylum bid abroad . `` unfortunately , gulnaz was heavily pressured to marry her attacker by various people within the government which , in and of itself , was immensely disappointing , '' her former attorney , an american citizen named kimberley motley , tells us . `` gulnaz was constantly told that neither she nor her daughter would be protected if she did not succumb to their pressure to marry ... gulnaz essentially became a prisoner of her environment . `` as an uneducated , young , single mother with no family support , it would have been an uphill battle for gulnaz and her daughter . '' local pressure won out . she was introduced to her attacker in the shelter where cnn first interviewed her upon release from prison . they talked and it was agreed she would marry him . most disturbingly , the woman who -- despite knowing the stigma it would create around her -- defiantly insisted she had been raped when we spoke nearly four years ago , now says she was told by her relatives to make up the allegations . `` now she is beside me and knows that it was not as big as they had shown it , '' says asadullah . `` no i am not thinking about it anymore , '' gulnaz adds . `` i do n't have a problem with him now and i do n't want to think about the past problems . my life is ok ... i am happy with my life ... it is going on . '' she is then permitted to talk with us alone . asadullah moves away but stands close to the door of the room . though she now maintains she was not raped , she explains her decision . she contradicts her husband , saying her brothers would have taken her back , had she not married him . `` my brothers opposed the marriage and told me to take my daughter and go to pakistan to live with them instead , '' she says . `` but now we 're married , they disowned me and wo n't see me again . '' her decision was for her daughter . `` no , i could n't fulfill my wishes in life . i married this man ; i cut relations with my family only to buy my daughter 's future . '' it is truly chilling to see how things have gone for gulnaz after the level of international attention her story received -- pregnant with the third child of the man who was once her rapist , accepting a life as his second wife , trapped in his home .\\x82\\x13\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\n\"\n",

'' thorpe 's background was not in photojournalism , but in landscape photography , which lends to his powerful placement of the soldiers in the desert -- not to mention that all the locations chosen are historic locations of battles between morocco and the polisario front . `` the conflict in western sahara receives virtually zero coverage despite 2015 being the 40th anniversary of the outbreak of war there , '' thorpe said . after a ceasefire in 1991 , the people of western sahara have been living in a state of non-resolution . the people are split into two camps -- those living in moroccan-occupied territory , and those in refugee camps in algeria . social media . follow @cnnphotos on twitter to join the conversation about photography . thorpe had to get clearance to work with the polisario front military and also had to be cautious of how many troops he moved about at one time -- otherwise he would have needed permission from the united nations . he usually worked with about 50 or 60 soldiers at a time . the autumn months did not offer much reprieve from the long hours in the sweltering desert sun . thorpe would work with the troops ' commander to position the men , then climb atop sandy mountains with his wide-angle lens and capture these striking images . they would work till dusk and then spend the night under the stars . not only were the soldiers willing participants for this project , but they also helped construct the platforms they stood on . thorpe said they were made out of old oil drums . after the elaborate five-week production , thorpe hopes his images will raise questions on `` how images of war -lrb- will -rrb- be consumed in the future with ever-diminishing attention spans and competition for them .

'' said baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake . an attorney for gray 's family alleges that police are involved in a cover-up . `` on last sunday morning at about 8 a.m. , the police chased freddie gray , a ... healthy man , without any evidence he had committed a crime . his take-down and arrest without probable cause occurred under a police video camera , which taped everything including the police dragging and throwing freddy into a police vehicle while he screamed in pain , '' attorney william murphy jr. said in a statement . video recorded at the scene shows gray , with his hands behind his back , screaming as police raise him to his feet . they drag him to a waiting van . `` he lapsed into a coma , died , was resuscitated , stayed in a coma and on monday , underwent extensive surgery at shock trauma to save his life . he clung to life for seven days and died today at approximately 7 a.m. . we believe the police are keeping the circumstances of freddie 's death secret until they develop a version of events that will absolve them of all responsibility , '' said murphy . the attorney added that gray 's spinal cord was severely injured . at this point , police are declining to say much about the case , citing ongoing administrative and criminal investigations . they have not released the incident report , nor have they released the names of the officers involved . they have said that those officers have been placed on administrative duties . when asked why officers first encountered gray , baltimore police dept. capt. eric kowalczyk told cnn that they had been working in an area known for violent crime and drug sales . when the officers approached him , gray fled , kowalczyk said . gray 's death comes amid a string of recent deaths involving white officers and black suspects . the death of michael brown in ferguson , missouri , touched off protests and sparked a nationwide debate over race and policing . brown , an unarmed black teen , was shot by darren wilson , a white officer , last august . according to cnn affiliate wjz , protesters rallied over the weekend in baltimore , demanding answers . `` our hope and goal here is to be as informative as we can without compromising the criminal investigation , '' said kowalczyk . `` we 're very troubled by this . we want to find out the answers as much as the public does .
